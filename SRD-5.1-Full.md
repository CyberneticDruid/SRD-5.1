# Appendix PH-A:

# Conditions

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety
of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class
feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most
conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a
few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.
A condition lasts either until it is countered (the
prone condition is countered by standing up, for
example) or for a duration specified by the effect
that imposed the condition.
If multiple effects impose the same condition on a
creature, each instance of the condition has its own
duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse.
A creature either has a condition or doesn't.
The following definitions specify what happens to
a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

#### Blinded

- A blinded creature can't see and automatically
 fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,
 and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

#### Charmed

- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or
 target the charmer with harmful abilities or
 magical effects.
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to
 interact socially with the creature.

#### Deafened

- A deafened creature can't hear and automatically
 fails any ability check that requires hearing.

##### Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as
starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching
temperatures, can lead to a special condition called
exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect
can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as
specified in the effect's description.

**Level
 Effect**
1
 Disadvantage on ability checks
2
 Speed halved
3
 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4
 Hit point maximum halved
5
 Speed reduced to 0

```
6
 Death
```

```
If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that
causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases
by the amount specified in the effect's description.
A creature suffers the effect of its current level of
exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature
suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has
disadvantage on ability checks.
An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as
specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion
effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced
below 1.
Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level
by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food
and drink.
```
#### Frightened

- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability
 checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear
 is within line of sight.
- The creature can't willingly move closer to the
 source of its fear.

#### Grappled

- A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it
 can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated
 (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the
 grappled creature from the reach of the grappler
 or grappling effect, such as when a creature is
 hurled away by the
 _thunder-wave_ spell.

#### Incapacitated

- An incapacitated creature can't take actions or
 reactions.

#### Invisible

- An invisible creature is impossible to see without
 the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose
 of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The
 creature's location can be detected by any noise it
 makes or any tracks it leaves.
- Attack rolls against the creature have
 disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have
 advantage.

#### Paralyzed

- A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the
 condition) and can't move or speak.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.


- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if
 the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

#### Petrified

- A petrified creature is transformed, along with any
 nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a
 solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its
 weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases
 aging.
- The creature is incapacitated (see the condition),
 can't move or speak, and is unaware of its
 surroundings.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- The creature has resistance to all damage.
- The creature is immune to poison and disease,
 although a poison or disease already in its system
 is suspended, not neutralized.

#### Poisoned

- A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack
 rolls and ability checks.

#### Prone

- A prone creature's only movement option is to
 crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the
 condition.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- An attack roll against the creature has advantage if
 the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
 Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

#### Restrained

- A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it
 can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,
 and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
- The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving
 throws.

#### Stunned

- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the
 condition), can't move, and can speak only
 falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

#### Unconscious

- An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the
 condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of
 its surroundings
- The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls
 prone.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if
 the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.


# Appendix PH-B:

# Fantasy-Historical

# Pantheons

The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are
fantasy interpretations of historical religions from
our world's ancient times. They include deities that
are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced
from their historical context in the real world and
united into pantheons that serve the needs of the
game.

#### The Celtic Pantheon

It's said that something wild lurks in the heart of
every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese
calling at night, to the whispering wind through the
pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an
oak--and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell.
They sprang from the brook and stream, their might
heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty
of the woodlands and open moor. When the first
forester dared put a name to the face seen in the
bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these
gods forced themselves into being.
The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by
clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of
nature that druids revere.

#### The Greek Pantheon

The gods of Olympus make themselves known with
the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the
crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded
peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere,
olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing.
Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence,
and they've made a place for themselves inside the
human heart, too.

#### The Egyptian Pantheon

```
These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine
family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the
maintenance of the divine principle of Ma'at--the
fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order
that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men
and women in their logical and rightful place in the
universe.
The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three
gods responsible for death, each with different
alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the
afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a
chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for
killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic
good goddess of mourning.
```
#### The Norse Pantheon

```
Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into
the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up
on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and
retreat with every fall and spring--this is the land of
the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It's a
brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The
warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh
conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been
too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given
the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it's
surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did.
Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for
strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see
their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in
the crash of the thunder and the booming of the
glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning
longhouse.
The Norse pantheon includes two main families,
the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir
(gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies,
these two families are now closely allied against
their common enemies, the giants (including the
gods Surtur and Thrym).

# Appendix PH-C:

# The Planes of

# Existence

The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well
as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the
**planes of existence** . It encompasses every world
where GMs run their adventures, all within the
relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane.
Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental
matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos,
the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions
of the gods.
Many spells and magic items can draw energy
from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell
the re, communicate with their denizens, and allow
adventurers to travel there. As your character
achieves greater power and higher levels, you might
walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle
on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with
each dawn.

## The Material Plane

The Material Plane is the nexus where the
philosophical and elemental forces that define the
other planes collide in the jumbled existence of
mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming
worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the
starting point for most campaigns and adventures.
The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to
the Material Plane.
The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely
diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of
the GMs who set their games there, as well as the
players whose heroes adventure there. They include
magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted
water worlds, worlds where magic combines with
advanced technology and others trapped in an
endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and
places they have abandoned.

## Beyond the Material

Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of
existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're
not simply other worlds, but different qualities of
being, formed and governed by spiritual and
elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary
world.

### Planar Travel

```
When adventurers travel into other planes of
existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey
across the thresholds of existence to a mythic
destination where they strive to complete their
quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving
the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial
servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in
its home city will be the subject of song and story for
years to come.
Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can
be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or
by using a planar portal.
Spells.
 A number of spells allow direct or indirect
access to other planes of existence.
 Plane shift and
gate can transport adventurers directly to any other
plane of existence, with different degrees of
precision.
 Etherealness allows adventurers to enter
the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of
the planes it touches--such as the Elemental Planes.
And the
 astral projection spell lets adventurers
project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel
to the Outer Planes.
Portals. A portal is a general term for a stationary
interplanar connection that links a specific location
on one plane to a specific location on another. Some
portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-
shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it
effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations--
circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing
ships, or even whole towns--that exist in multiple
planes at once or flicker from one plane to another
in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an
Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the
Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano
(leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the
ocean (to the Plane of Water).
```
### Transitive Planes

```
The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called
the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless
realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from
one plane to another. Spells such as etherealness and
astral projection allow characters to enter these
planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.
The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound
dimension that is sometimes described as a great
ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap
the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that
every location on those planes has a corresponding
location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can
see into the Border Ethereal, and the
 see invisibility
```

and
 _true seeing_ spell grant that ability. Some magical
effects also extend from the Material Plane into the
Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force
energy such as
 _forcecage_ and
 _wall of force._ The
depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region
of swirling mists and colorful fogs.
The ** Astral Plane** is the realm of thought and
dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to
reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a
great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with
swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among
motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic
whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning
coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found
here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open
domain.

### Inner Planes

The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material
Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental
substance from which all the worlds were made. The
four
 **Elemental Planes** --Air, Earth, Fire, and
Water--form a ring around the Material Plane,
suspended within the churning
 **Elemental Chaos** .
At their innermost edges, where they are closest
to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal
geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes
resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four
elements mingle together as they do in the Material
Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the
Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are
both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in
their purest form--great expanses of solid earth,
blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air.
These regions are little-known, so when discussing
the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually
means just the border region. At the farthest extents
of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and
bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing
energies and colliding substance, the Elemental
Chaos.

### Outer Planes

If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy
that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are
the direction, thought and purpose for such
construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the
Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or
godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as
the homes of deities.
When discussing anything to do with deities, the
language used must be highly metaphorical. Their

```
actual homes are not literally "places" at all, but
exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms
of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes,
one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer
Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive
spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory
experience.
Even in those perceptible regions, appearances
can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes
appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the
Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the
whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer
Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell
on these planes can remake them completely,
effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to
better fulfill their own needs.
Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the
Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes
often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on
to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to
take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first
layer to the ninth, in a single day--if the powers of
the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for
travelers to make a grueling trek across a single
layer.
The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of
sixteen planes that correspond to the eight
alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of
distinction between them.
```
#### Outer Planes

```
The planes with some element of good in their
nature are called the
 Upper Planes . Celestial
creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the
Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are
the
 Lower Planes . Fiends such as demons and devils
dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is its
essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't
match the plane's experiences a profound sense of
dissonance there. When a good creature visits
Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane),
it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature
feels out of tune and more than a little
uncomfortable.
```
#### Demiplanes

```
Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with
their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality
that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes
come into being by a variety of means. Some are
created by spells, such as
 demiplane, or generated at
the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They
may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that
```

has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse,
or as a baby universe growing in power. A given
demiplane can be entered through a single point
where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a
_plane shift_ spell can also carry travelers to a
demiplane, but the proper frequency required for
the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The
_gate_ spell is more reliable, assuming the caster
knows of the demiplane.

The arctic-dwelling **winter wolf** is as large as a dire wolf but has
snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil creatures as
guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves' deadly breath weapon to use

A worg is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures
weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote
wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs
as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or
malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to
speak Common as well.


# Appendix MM-B:

# Nonplayer

# Characters

This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid nonplayer characters
(NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign, including lowly
commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be used to represent
both human and nonhuman NPCs.

### Customizing NPCs

There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home
campaign.

**_Racial Traits. _** You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a
halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding
racial traits to an NPC doesn't alter its challenge rating. For more on racial
traits, see the _Player's Handbook_ .

**_Spell Swaps._** One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one
or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC's spell list
with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping
spells in this manner doesn't alter an NPC's challenge rating.

**_Armor and Weapon Swaps._** You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC's armor, or
add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an
NPC's challenge rating.

**_Magic Items. _** The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or
more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a
magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC
a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.

**Archmages** are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to
the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while
evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor
evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without
interruption.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's
abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

Assassinate. During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls
against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores
against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

Evasion. If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no
damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

Sneak Attack. Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when
it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or
when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't
incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
```

##### Actions

```
Multiattack. The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.
Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15

**Bandits** rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or
spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or
famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.

##### Reactions

```
Parry. The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit
it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee
weapon.
```

```
It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a
gang of bandits in line. The bandit captain has these qualities in spades. In
addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a
variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep
the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a
regular basis. More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves
infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely
to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know
anything of the captain's colorful reputation.

# Monsters

A monster's statistics, sometimes referred to as its
**stat block** , provide the essential information that
you need to run the monster.

### Size

A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge,
or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how
much space a creature of a particular size controls in
combat. See the
 _Player's Handbook_ for more
info rmation on creature size and space.

#### Size Categories

**Size Space Examples**
Tiny 2[-1/2] by 2[-1/2] ft. Imp, sprite
Small 5 by 5 ft. Giant rat, goblin
Medium 5 by 5 ft. Orc, werewolf
Large 10 by 10 ft. Hippogriff, ogre
Huge 15 by 15 ft. Fire giant, treant
Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger Kraken, purple worm

##### Modifying Creatures

Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you
might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect
creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an
existing creature to make it into something more useful for
you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different
monster or by using a
 **variant** or
 **template** , such as the ones
in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster,
including when you apply a template to it, might change its
challenge rating.

### Type

A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature.
Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other
effects in the game interact in special ways with
creatures of a particular type. For example, an
 _arrow
of dragon slaying_ deals extra damage not only to
dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type,
such as dragon turtles and wyverns.
The game includes the following monster types,
which have no rules of their own.
**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of
them have innate magical abilities drawn from the
creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces
of the world. The quintessential aberrations are
aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.
**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a
natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them

```
have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and
lack any society or language. Beasts include all
varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant
versions of animals.
Celestials are creatures native to the Upper
Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities,
employed as messengers or agents in the mortal
realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good
by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays
from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity.
Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.
Constructs are made, not born. Some are
programmed by their creators to follow a simple set
of instructions, while others are imbued with
sentience and capable of independent thought.
Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures
native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as
modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw
material of the plane by the will of more powerful
creatures.
Dragons are large reptilian creatures of ancient
origin and tremendous power. True dragons,
including the good metallic dragons and the evil
chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have
innate magic. Also in this category are creatures
distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful,
less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns
and pseudodragons.
Elementals
 are creatures native to the elemental
planes. Some creatures of this type are little more
than animate masses of their respective elements,
including the creatures simply called elementals.
Others have biological forms infused with elemental
energy. The races of genies, including djinn and
efreet, form the most important civilizations on the
elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include
azers and invisible stalkers.
Fey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces
of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty
forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the
Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are
also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the
planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include
dryads, pixies, and satyrs.
Fiends are creatures of wickedness that are native
to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities,
but many more labor under the leadership of
archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and
mages sometimes summon fiends to the material
world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a
rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends
include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and
yugoloths.
```

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They
are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple
heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six
varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants,
frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm
giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and
trolls are giants.
**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy
gaming world, both civilized and savage, including
humans and a tremendous variety of other species.
They have language and culture, few if any innate
magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn
spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common
humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player
characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings.
Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal,
and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids
(goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls,
lizardfolk, and kobolds.
**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest
sense--frightening creatures that are not ordinary,
not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are
the results of magical experimentation gone awry
(such as owlbears), and others are the product of
terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti).
They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as
a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into
any other type.
**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a
fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling
in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion,
or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way.
Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the
most recognizable oozes.
**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not
ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and
some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are
the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal
creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also
fall into this category.
**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a
horrifying state of undeath through the practice of
necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead
include walking corpses, such as vampires and
zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts
and specters.

#### Tags

A monster might have one or more tags appended to
its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the
_humanoid (orc)_ type. The parenthetical tags provide
additional categorization for certain creatures. The
tags have no rules of their own, but something in the

```
game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For
instance, a spear that is especially effective at
fighting demons would work against any monster
that has the demon tag.
```
### Alignment

```
A monster's alignment provides a clue to its
disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or
combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil
monster might be difficult to reason with and might
attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral
monster might be willing to negotiate. See the
Player's Handbook for descriptions of the different
alignments.
The alignment specified in a monster's stat block
is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change
a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your
campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon
or an evil storm giant, there's nothing stopping you.
Some creatures can have
 any alignment . In other
words, you choose the monster's alignment. Some
monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or
aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For
example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment
(chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as
befits its wild nature.
Many creatures of low intelligence have no
comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They
don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act
on instinct. These creatures are
 unaligned , which
means they don't have an alignment.
```
### Armor Class

```
A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has
an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and
Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is
based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if
any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or
carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its
AC value.
```
### Hit Points

```
A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops
to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the
Player's Handbook.
A monster's hit points are presented both as a die
expression and as an average number. For example,
a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on
average (2 [x] 4[-1/2]).
A monster's size determines the die used to
calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by
Size table.
```

#### Hit Dice by Size

**Monster Size Hit Die Average HP per Die**
Tiny d4 2[-1/2]
Small d6 3[-1/2]
Medium d8 4[-1/2]
Large d10 5[-1/2]
Huge d12 6[-1/2]
Gargantuan d20 10[-1/2]

A monster's Constitution modifier also affects the
number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier
is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses,
and the result is added to its hit points. For example,
if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier)
and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average
11).

### Speed

A monster's speed tells you how far it can move on
its turn. For more information on speed, see the
_Player's Handbook._
All creatures have a walking speed, simply called
the monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of
ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0
feet.
Some creatures have one or more of the following
additional movement modes.

#### Burrow

A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that
speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A
monster can't burrow through solid rock unless it
has a special trait that allows it to do so.

#### Climb

A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or
part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces.
The monster doesn't need to spend extra movement
to climb.

#### Fly

A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part
of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the
ability to
 **hover** , which makes them hard to knock
out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in
the
 _Player's Handbook_ ). Such a monster stops
hovering when it dies.

#### Swim

A monster that has a swimming speed doesn't need
to spend extra movement to swim.

### Ability Scores

```
Every monster has six ability scores (Strength,
Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more
information on ability scores and how they're used
in play, see the
 Player's Handbook.
```
### Saving Throws

```
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures
that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects.
For example, a creature that isn't easily charmed or
frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving
throws. Most creatures don't have special saving
throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.
A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster's
relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus,
which is determined by the monster's challenge
rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by
Challenge Rating table).
```
#### Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating

### Skills

```
The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are
proficient in one or more skills. For example, a
monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might
have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity
(Stealth) checks.
A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant
ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is
determined by the monster's challenge rating (as
shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating
table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a
```

monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus
(usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for
its heightened expertise.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and

### Immunities

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or
immunity to certain types of damage. Particular
creatures are even resistant or immune to damage
from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an
attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another
magical source). In addition, some creatures are
immune to certain conditions.

### Senses

The Senses entry notes a monster's passive Wisdom
(Perception) score, as well as any special senses the
monster might have. Special senses are described
below.

#### Blindsight

A monster with blindsight can perceive its
surroundings without relying on sight, within a
specific radius.
Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and
gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do
creatures with echolocation or heightened senses,
such as bats and true dragons.
If a monster is naturally blind, it has a
parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the
radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range
of its perception.

#### Darkvision

A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within
a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light
within the radius as if it were bright light, and in
darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many
creatures that live underground have this special
sense.

##### Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies

Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons,
and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the
creature is proficient with its new equipment.
For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and
wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain
mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is
proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.
See the
 _Player's Handbook_ for rules on using armor or
weapons without proficiency.

#### Tremorsense

```
A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint
the origin of vibrations within a specific radius,
provided that the monster and the source of the
vibrations are in contact with the same ground or
substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect
flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing
creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have
this special sense.
```
#### Truesight

```
A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range,
see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible
creatures and objects, automatically detect visual
illusions and succeed on saving throws against them,
and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or
a creature that is transformed by magic.
Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal
Plane within the same range.
```
### Languages

```
The languages that a monster can speak are listed in
alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can
understand a language but can't speak it, and this is
noted in its entry. A "--" indicates that a creature
neither speaks nor understands any language.
```
#### Telepathy

```
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster
to communicate mentally with another creature
within a specified range. The contacted creature
doesn't need to share a language with the monster to
communicate in this way with it, but it must be able
to understand at least one language. A creature
without telepathy can receive and respond to
telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a
telepathic conversation.
A telepathic monster doesn't need to see a
contacted creature and can end the telepathic
contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as
the two creatures are no longer within range of each
other or if the telepathic monster contacts a
different creature within range. A telepathic monster
can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation
without using an action, but while the monster is
incapacitated, it can't initiate telepathic contact, and
any current contact is terminated.
A creature within the area of an
 antimagic field or
in any other location where magic doesn't function
can't send or receive telepathic messages.
```

### Challenge

A monster's
 **challenge rating** tells you how great a
threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped
and well-rested party of four adventurers should be
able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating
equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For
example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should
find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a
worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.
Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-
level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1.
Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are
insignificant except in large numbers; those with no
effective attacks are worth no experience points,
while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.
Some monsters present a greater challenge than
even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These
monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and
are specifically designed to test player skill.

#### Experience Points

The number of experience points (XP) a monster is
worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP
is awarded for defeating the monster, although the
GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat
posed by the monster in some other manner.
Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster
summoned by a spell or other magical ability is
worth the XP noted in its stat block.

### Special Traits

```
Special traits (which appear after a monster's
challenge rating but before any actions or reactions)
are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a
combat encounter and that require some
explanation.
```
#### Innate Spellcasting

```
A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has
the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted
otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is
always cast at its lowest possible level and can't be
cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip
where its level matters and no level is given, use the
monster's challenge rating.
An innate spell can have special rules or
restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately
cast the
 levitate spell, but the spell has a "self only"
restriction, which means that the spell affects only
the drow mage.
A monster's innate spells can't be swapped out
with other spells. If a monster's innate spells don't
require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for
them.
```
#### Spellcasting

```
A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a
spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast
its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the
Player's Handbook ). The spellcaster level is also used
for any cantrips included in the feature.
The monster has a list of spells known or prepared
from a specific class. The list might also include
spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine
Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle
feature of the druid. The monster is considered a
member of that class when attuning to or using a
magic item that requires membership in the class or
access to its spell list.
A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher
level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a
drow mage with the 3rd-level
 lightning bolt spell can
cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level
spell slots.
You can change the spells that a monster knows or
has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with
a spell of the same level and from the same class list.
If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a
greater or lesser threat than suggested by its
challenge rating.
```

#### Psionics

A monster that casts spells using only the power of
its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting
or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries
no special rules of its own, but other parts of the
game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag
typically doesn't require any components to cast its
spells.

### Actions

When a monster takes its action, it can choose from
the options in the Actions section of its stat block or
use one of the actions available to all creatures, such
as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the
_Player's Handbook_ .

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks

The most common actions that a monster will take
in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can
be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the
"weapon" might be a manufactured item or a natural
weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more
information on different kinds of attacks, see the
_Player's Handbook_.
**_Creature vs. Target._** The target of a melee or
ranged attack is usually either one creature or one
target, the difference being that a "target" can be a
creature or an object.
**_Hit._** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur
as a result of an attack hitting a target are described
after the " _Hit_ " notation. You have the option of
taking average damage or rolling the damage; for
this reason, both the average damage and the die
expression are presented.
**_Miss._** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a
miss, that information is presented after the " _Miss:_ "
notation.

#### Multiattack

A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn
has the Multiattack action. A creature can't use
Multiattack when making an opportunity attack,
which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition

A monster carries enough ammunition to make its
ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has
2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon
attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a
projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.

### Reactions

```
If a monster can do something special with its
reaction, that information is contained here. If a
creature has no special reaction, this section is
absent.
```
### Limited Usage

```
Some special abilities have restrictions on the
number of times they can be used.
X/Day. The notation "X/Day" means a special
ability can be used X number of times and that a
monster must finish a long rest to regain expended
uses. For example, "1/Day" means a special ability
can be used once and that the monster must finish a
long rest to use it again.
Recharge X-Y. The notation "Recharge X-Y"
means a monster can use a special ability once and
that the ability then has a random chance of
recharging during each subsequent round of combat.
At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6.
If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge
notation, the monster regains the use of the special
ability. The ability also recharges when the monster
finishes a short or long rest.
For example, "Recharge 5-6" means a monster can
use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the
monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it
rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.
Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This
notation means that a monster can use a special
ability once and then must finish a short or long rest
to use it again.
```
##### Grapple Rules for Monsters

```
Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to
quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an
attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to
determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack
says otherwise.
A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to
try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape
DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given,
assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (Athletics)
modifier.
```
### Equipment

```
A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than
armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature
that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid,
is assumed to be dressed appropriately.
```

You can equip monsters with additional gear and
trinkets however you like, and you decide how much
of a monster's equipment is recoverable after the
creature is slain and whether any of that equipment
is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a
monster is rarely usable by someone else, for
instance.
If a spellcasting monster needs material
components to cast its spells, assume that it has the
material components it needs to cast the spells in its
stat block.

## Legendary Creatures

A legendary creature can do things that ordinary
creatures can't. It can take special actions outside its
turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles
around.
If a creature assumes the form of a legendary
creature, such as through a spell, it doesn't gain that
form's legendary actions, lair actions, or regional
effects.

### Legendary Actions

A legendary creature can take a certain number of
special actions--called legendary actions--outside
its turn. Only one legendary action option can be
used at a time and only at the end of another
creature's turn. A creature regains its spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo
using them, and it can't use them while incapacitated
or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it
can't use them until after its first turn in the combat.

### A Legendary Creature's Lair

A legendary creature might have a section
describing its lair and the special effects it can create
while there, either by act of will or simply by being
present. Such a section applies only to a legendary
creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.

#### Lair Actions

If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use
them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On
initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can
use one of its lair action options. It can't do so while
incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If
surprised, it can't use one until after its first turn in
the combat.

#### Regional Effects

The mere presence of a legendary creature can have
strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as

```
noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly
or dissipate over time when the legendary creature
dies.
```

## Monsters (A)

#### Aboleth

**_Amphibious._** The aboleth can breathe air and water.

**_Mucous Cloud._** While underwater, the aboleth is
surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that
touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack
while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14
Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is
diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can
breathe only underwater.

**_Probing Telepathy._** If a creature communicates
telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the
creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the
creature.

##### Actions

**_Multiattack._** The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.

**_Tentacle.
_** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target.
 _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If
the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The
disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed
by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the
diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy,
the creature can't regain hit points unless it is
underwater, and the disease can be removed only by
_heal
_ or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or
higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it
takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless
moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have
passed.

Petrifying Gaze. If a creature starts its turn within 30

success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is
petrified until freed by the
 greater restoration spell or

A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to
avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does
so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn,
when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the
basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the
save.

itself with its gaze.

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11

**Languages** Deep Speech, Undercommon

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)

**_Damage Transfer._** While attached to a creature, the
cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded
down), and that creature takes the other half.

**_False Appearance._** While the cloaker remains
motionless without its underside exposed, it is
indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.

**_Light Sensitivity.
_** While in bright light, the cloaker has
disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight.

##### Actions

```
Multiattack. The cloaker makes two attacks: one with
its bite and one with its tail.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
 Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the
target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If
the cloaker has advantage against the target, the
cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is
blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is
attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this
attack only against the target and has advantage on the
attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5
feet of its movement. A creature, including the target,
can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding
on a DC 16 Strength check.
Tail.
 Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
creature.
 Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.
Moan. Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that
can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must
succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a
creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is
immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours
Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The
cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of
itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with
it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make
it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If
the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the
duplicates disappear.
Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an
attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains,
that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it
targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature
is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it
relies on senses other than sight.
A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving
throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate
fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage,
the duplicate disappears.

```
##### Actions

```
Bite.
 Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
 Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the
target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until this poison
ends, the target is unconscious. Another creature can
use an action to shake the target awake.
Constrict.
 Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one Medium or smaller creature.
 Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3)
bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled
(escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is
restrained, and the couatl can't constrict another
target.
Change Shape.
 The couatl magically polymorphs into a
humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to
or less than its own, or back into its true form. It
reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new
form (the couatl's choice).
In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics
and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes,
Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by
those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and
capabilities (except class features, legendary actions,
and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.
If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its
bite in that form.

**Challenge** 1/2 (100 XP)

**_Echolocation._** The darkmantle can't use its blindsight
while deafened.

**_False Appearance._** While the darkmantle remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from a cave
formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite.

##### Actions

**_Crush.
_** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
 _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the
darkmantle attaches to the target. If the target is
Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage
on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target's
head, and the target is also blinded and unable to
breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way.
While attached to the target, the darkmantle can
attack no other creature except the target but has
advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle's speed
also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its
speed, and it moves with the target.
A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a
successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its
turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target
by using 5 feet of movement.

**_Darkness Aura (1/Day)._** A 15-foot radius of magical
darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with
it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as
long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to
10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision
can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can
illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an
area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower,
the spell creating the light is dispelled.

Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The explosion ignites flammable
objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried,

creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage,
and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being
worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the
balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet

Chain.
 Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft.,

reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points
or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.

**_Wall of Ice (Recharge 6)._** The devil magically forms an
opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within
60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet
long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up
to 20 feet in diameter.
When the wall appears, each creature in its space is
pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature
chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the
creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a
DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

```
successful one.
The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is
incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and
breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points,
vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold,
necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is
destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the
space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes
moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or
otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17
Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest
of the wall vanishes.

throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence
for the next 24 hours.

whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures
restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The
whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

**_Horrifying Visage.

feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC
13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 [x]
10
 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for
the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed

```
with a
 greater restoration spell, but only within 24
hours of it occurring.
Possession (Recharge 6). One humanoid that the ghost
can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13
Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost;
the ghost then disappears, and the target is
incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost
now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target
of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any
attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn
undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed
and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed
target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the
target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit
points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost
is turned or forced out by an effect like the
 dispel evil
and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost
reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession
for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or
after the possession ends.

##### Actions

```
Claws.
 Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
 Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
Illusory Appearance.
 The hag covers herself and
anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical
illusion that makes her look like another creature of
her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends
if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear
to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would
feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take
an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on
a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern
that the hag is disguised.
Invisible Passage. The hag magically turns invisible
until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her
concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her
passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any
equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

**_Change Shape._** The hag magically polymorphs into a
Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her
true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any
equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
She reverts to her true form if she dies.

**_Etherealness._** The hag magically enters the Ethereal
Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so,
the hag must have a
 _heartstone
_ in her possession.

**_Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)._** While on the Ethereal
Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid
on the Material Plane. A
 _protection from evil and good_
spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a
_magic circle_ . As long as the contact persists, the target
has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1
hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its
hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect
reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target
dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the
hag's
 _soul bag_ . The reduction to the target's hit point
maximum lasts until removed by the
 _greater
restoration_ spell or similar magic.

a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect
ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific
Appearance for the next 24 hours.
Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the

the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving
throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.
Illusory Appearance.
 The hag covers herself and
anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical
illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her
general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if
the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear
to have no claws, but someone touching her hand
might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take
an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on

Luring Song.
 The harpy sings a magical melody. Every

saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The
harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns
to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The
song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.
While charmed by the harpy, a target is
incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If
the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the
harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the
harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5
feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before
moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and
whenever it takes damage from a source other than
the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A
charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is
successful, the effect ends on it.
A target that successfully saves is immune to this
harpy's song for the next 24 hours.

effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid
damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns.
If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single
turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed
on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that
turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall
prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the

tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a
random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown
target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6)
bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If
the target is thrown at another creature, that creature
must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or
take the same damage and be knocked prone.

bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the
kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must

**_Petrifying Gaze.
_** When a creature that can see the
medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the
medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14
Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't
incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving
throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly
petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save
begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The
restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at
the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure
or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts
until the creature is freed by the
 _greater restoration_
spell or other magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to
avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the
creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start
of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the
creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must
immediately make the save.
If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished

```
surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light,
the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own
gaze.

Ooze Cube. The cube takes up its entire space. Other
creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does
so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has
disadvantage on the saving throw.
Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total
cover.
A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an
```

action to pull a creature or object out of the cube.
Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength check,
and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6)
acid damage.
The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to
four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.

**_Transparent.
_** Even when the cube is in plain sight, it
takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to
spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A
creature that tries to enter the cube's space while
unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.

##### Actions

**_Pseudopod._** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5
ft., one creature.
 _Hit:_ 10 (3d6) acid damage.

**_Engulf._** The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so,
it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces.
Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the
creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.
On a successful save, the creature can choose to be
pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A
creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the
consequences of a failed saving throw.
On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's
space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage
and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is
restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start
of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the
engulfed creature moves with it.
An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an
action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success,
the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice
within 5 feet of the cube.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
 Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is
a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw against disease or become poisoned until
the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the
target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit
point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is
cured on a success. The target dies if the disease
reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to
the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is
cured.
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target.
 Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4
(1d8) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or

it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must
succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take

the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't
stunned.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)._** If the tarrasque fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Magic Resistance._** The tarrasque has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Reflective Carapace._** Any time the tarrasque is
targeted by a
 _magic missile
_ spell, a line spell, or a spell
that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5,
the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is
unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the
caster as though it originated from the tarrasque,
turning the caster into the target.

**_Siege Monster.
_** The tarrasque deals double damage to
objects and structures.

##### Actions

```
Multiattack. The tarrasque can use its Frightful
Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite,
two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its
tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target.
 Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the
target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until
this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the
tarrasque can't bite another target.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft.,
one target.
 Hit:
 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.
Horns. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target.
 Hit: 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage.
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one
target.
 Hit: 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the
target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Frightful Presence.
 Each creature of the tarrasque's
choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with
disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight,
ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful
Presence for the next 24 hours.
Swallow. The tarrasque makes one bite attack against
a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack
hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is
swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the
creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover
against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque,
and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each
of the tarrasque's turns.
If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single
turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must
succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the
end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures,
which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the
tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature
is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the
corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.
```

from the options below. Only one legendary action
option can be used at a time and only at the end of

```
Shapechanger. If the vampire isn't in sunlight or
running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a
Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its
true form.
While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its
walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30
feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are
unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it,
but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true
form if it dies.
While in mist form, the vampire can't take any
actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless,
has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter
a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if
air can pass through a space, the mist can do so
without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It
has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
```

saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical
damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)._** If the vampire fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Misty Escape._** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its
resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of
mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling
unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or
running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.
While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert
to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place
within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting
place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed
until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1
hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit
point.

**_Regeneration._** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the
start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in
sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant
damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't
function at the start of the vampire's next turn.

**_Spider Climb._** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces,
including upside down on ceilings, without needing to
make an ability check.

**_Vampire Weaknesses._** The vampire has the following
flaws:
_Forbiddance.
_ The vampire can't enter a residence
without an invitation from one of the occupants.
_Harmed by Running Water._ The vampire takes 20
acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
_Stake to the Heart.
_ If a piercing weapon made of
wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the
vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the
vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.
_Sunlight Hypersensitivity._ The vampire takes 20
radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight.
While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls
and ability checks.

##### Actions

**_Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).
_** The vampire makes
two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

**_Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)._** _Melee Weapon
Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
 _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 +
4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage,
the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

**_Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)._** _Melee Weapon
Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a
creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated,

```
or restrained.
 Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10
(3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum
is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage
taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that
amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a
long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit
point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and
then buried in the ground rises the following night as a
vampire spawn under the vampire's control.
Charm. The vampire targets one humanoid it can see
within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire,
the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving
throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire.
The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted
friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target
isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's
requests or actions in the most favorable way it can,
and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.
Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions
do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the
saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the
vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of
existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to
end the effect.
Children of the Night (1/Day). The vampire magically
calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun
isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6
wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4
rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its
spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until
the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them
as a bonus action.
```
##### Legendary Actions

# Appendix PH-A:

# Conditions

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety
of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class
feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most
conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a
few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.
A condition lasts either until it is countered (the
prone condition is countered by standing up, for
example) or for a duration specified by the effect
that imposed the condition.
If multiple effects impose the same condition on a
creature, each instance of the condition has its own
duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse.
A creature either has a condition or doesn't.
The following definitions specify what happens to
a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

#### Blinded

- A blinded creature can't see and automatically
 fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,
 and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

#### Charmed

- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or
 target the charmer with harmful abilities or
 magical effects.
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to
 interact socially with the creature.

#### Deafened

- A deafened creature can't hear and automatically
 fails any ability check that requires hearing.

##### Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as
starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching
temperatures, can lead to a special condition called
exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect
can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as
specified in the effect's description.

**Level
 Effect**
1
 Disadvantage on ability checks
2
 Speed halved
3
 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4
 Hit point maximum halved
5
 Speed reduced to 0

```
6
 Death
```

```
If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that
causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases
by the amount specified in the effect's description.
A creature suffers the effect of its current level of
exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature
suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has
disadvantage on ability checks.
An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as
specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion
effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced
below 1.
Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level
by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food
and drink.
```
#### Frightened

- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability
 checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear
 is within line of sight.
- The creature can't willingly move closer to the
 source of its fear.

#### Grappled

- A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it
 can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated
 (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the
 grappled creature from the reach of the grappler
 or grappling effect, such as when a creature is
 hurled away by the
 _thunder-wave_ spell.

#### Incapacitated

- An incapacitated creature can't take actions or
 reactions.

#### Invisible

- An invisible creature is impossible to see without
 the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose
 of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The
 creature's location can be detected by any noise it
 makes or any tracks it leaves.
- Attack rolls against the creature have
 disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have
 advantage.

#### Paralyzed

- A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the
 condition) and can't move or speak.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.


- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if
 the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

#### Petrified

- A petrified creature is transformed, along with any
 nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a
 solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its
 weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases
 aging.
- The creature is incapacitated (see the condition),
 can't move or speak, and is unaware of its
 surroundings.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- The creature has resistance to all damage.
- The creature is immune to poison and disease,
 although a poison or disease already in its system
 is suspended, not neutralized.

#### Poisoned

- A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack
 rolls and ability checks.

#### Prone

- A prone creature's only movement option is to
 crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the
 condition.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- An attack roll against the creature has advantage if
 the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
 Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

#### Restrained

- A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it
 can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,
 and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
- The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving
 throws.

#### Stunned

- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the
 condition), can't move, and can speak only
 falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

#### Unconscious

- An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the
 condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of
 its surroundings
- The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls
 prone.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if
 the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.


# Appendix PH-B:

# Fantasy-Historical

# Pantheons

The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are
fantasy interpretations of historical religions from
our world's ancient times. They include deities that
are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced
from their historical context in the real world and
united into pantheons that serve the needs of the
game.

#### The Celtic Pantheon

It's said that something wild lurks in the heart of
every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese
calling at night, to the whispering wind through the
pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an
oak--and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell.
They sprang from the brook and stream, their might
heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty
of the woodlands and open moor. When the first
forester dared put a name to the face seen in the
bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these
gods forced themselves into being.
The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by
clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of
nature that druids revere.

#### The Greek Pantheon

The gods of Olympus make themselves known with
the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the
crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded
peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere,
olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing.
Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence,
and they've made a place for themselves inside the
human heart, too.

#### The Egyptian Pantheon

```
These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine
family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the
maintenance of the divine principle of Ma'at--the
fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order
that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men
and women in their logical and rightful place in the
universe.
The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three
gods responsible for death, each with different
alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the
afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a
chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for
killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic
good goddess of mourning.
```
#### The Norse Pantheon

```
Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into
the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up
on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and
retreat with every fall and spring--this is the land of
the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It's a
brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The
warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh
conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been
too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given
the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it's
surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did.
Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for
strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see
their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in
the crash of the thunder and the booming of the
glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning
longhouse.
The Norse pantheon includes two main families,
the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir
(gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies,
these two families are now closely allied against
their common enemies, the giants (including the
gods Surtur and Thrym).

# Appendix PH-C:

# The Planes of

# Existence

The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well
as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the
**planes of existence** . It encompasses every world
where GMs run their adventures, all within the
relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane.
Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental
matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos,
the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions
of the gods.
Many spells and magic items can draw energy
from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell
the re, communicate with their denizens, and allow
adventurers to travel there. As your character
achieves greater power and higher levels, you might
walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle
on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with
each dawn.

## The Material Plane

The Material Plane is the nexus where the
philosophical and elemental forces that define the
other planes collide in the jumbled existence of
mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming
worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the
starting point for most campaigns and adventures.
The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to
the Material Plane.
The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely
diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of
the GMs who set their games there, as well as the
players whose heroes adventure there. They include
magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted
water worlds, worlds where magic combines with
advanced technology and others trapped in an
endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and
places they have abandoned.

## Beyond the Material

Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of
existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're
not simply other worlds, but different qualities of
being, formed and governed by spiritual and
elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary
world.

### Planar Travel

```
When adventurers travel into other planes of
existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey
across the thresholds of existence to a mythic
destination where they strive to complete their
quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving
the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial
servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in
its home city will be the subject of song and story for
years to come.
Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can
be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or
by using a planar portal.
Spells.
 A number of spells allow direct or indirect
access to other planes of existence.
 Plane shift and
gate can transport adventurers directly to any other
plane of existence, with different degrees of
precision.
 Etherealness allows adventurers to enter
the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of
the planes it touches--such as the Elemental Planes.
And the
 astral projection spell lets adventurers
project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel
to the Outer Planes.
Portals. A portal is a general term for a stationary
interplanar connection that links a specific location
on one plane to a specific location on another. Some
portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-
shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it
effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations--
circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing
ships, or even whole towns--that exist in multiple
planes at once or flicker from one plane to another
in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an
Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the
Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano
(leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the
ocean (to the Plane of Water).
```
### Transitive Planes

```
The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called
the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless
realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from
one plane to another. Spells such as etherealness and
astral projection allow characters to enter these
planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.
The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound
dimension that is sometimes described as a great
ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap
the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that
every location on those planes has a corresponding
location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can
see into the Border Ethereal, and the
 see invisibility
```

and
 _true seeing_ spell grant that ability. Some magical
effects also extend from the Material Plane into the
Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force
energy such as
 _forcecage_ and
 _wall of force._ The
depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region
of swirling mists and colorful fogs.
The ** Astral Plane** is the realm of thought and
dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to
reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a
great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with
swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among
motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic
whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning
coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found
here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open
domain.

### Inner Planes

The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material
Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental
substance from which all the worlds were made. The
four
 **Elemental Planes** --Air, Earth, Fire, and
Water--form a ring around the Material Plane,
suspended within the churning
 **Elemental Chaos** .
At their innermost edges, where they are closest
to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal
geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes
resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four
elements mingle together as they do in the Material
Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the
Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are
both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in
their purest form--great expanses of solid earth,
blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air.
These regions are little-known, so when discussing
the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually
means just the border region. At the farthest extents
of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and
bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing
energies and colliding substance, the Elemental
Chaos.

### Outer Planes

If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy
that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are
the direction, thought and purpose for such
construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the
Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or
godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as
the homes of deities.
When discussing anything to do with deities, the
language used must be highly metaphorical. Their

```
actual homes are not literally "places" at all, but
exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms
of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes,
one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer
Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive
spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory
experience.
Even in those perceptible regions, appearances
can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes
appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the
Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the
whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer
Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell
on these planes can remake them completely,
effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to
better fulfill their own needs.
Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the
Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes
often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on
to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to
take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first
layer to the ninth, in a single day--if the powers of
the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for
travelers to make a grueling trek across a single
layer.
The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of
sixteen planes that correspond to the eight
alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of
distinction between them.
```
#### Outer Planes

```
The planes with some element of good in their
nature are called the
 Upper Planes . Celestial
creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the
Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are
the
 Lower Planes . Fiends such as demons and devils
dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is its
essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't
match the plane's experiences a profound sense of
dissonance there. When a good creature visits
Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane),
it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature
feels out of tune and more than a little
uncomfortable.
```
#### Demiplanes

```
Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with
their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality
that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes
come into being by a variety of means. Some are
created by spells, such as
 demiplane, or generated at
the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They
may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that
```

has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse,
or as a baby universe growing in power. A given
demiplane can be entered through a single point
where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a
_plane shift_ spell can also carry travelers to a
demiplane, but the proper frequency required for
the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The
_gate_ spell is more reliable, assuming the caster
knows of the demiplane.

The majestic giant elk is rare to the point that its appearance is often taken
as a foreshadowing of an important event, such as the birth of a king. Legends
tell of gods that take the form of giant elk when visiting the Material Plane.
Many cultures therefore believe that to hunt these creatures is to invite
divine wrath.

The arctic-dwelling **winter wolf** is as large as a dire wolf but has
snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil creatures as
guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves' deadly breath weapon to use

A worg is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures
weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote
wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs
as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or
malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to
speak Common as well.


# Appendix MM-B:

# Nonplayer

# Characters

This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid nonplayer characters
(NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign, including lowly
commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be used to represent
both human and nonhuman NPCs.

### Customizing NPCs

There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home
campaign.

**_Racial Traits. _** You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a
halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding
racial traits to an NPC doesn't alter its challenge rating. For more on racial
traits, see the _Player's Handbook_ .

**_Spell Swaps._** One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one
or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC's spell list
with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping
spells in this manner doesn't alter an NPC's challenge rating.

**_Armor and Weapon Swaps._** You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC's armor, or
add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an
NPC's challenge rating.

**_Magic Items. _** The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or
more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a
magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC
a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.

**Archmages** are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to
the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while
evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor
evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without
interruption.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's
abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

Assassinate. During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls
against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores
against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

Evasion. If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no
damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

Sneak Attack. Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when
it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or
when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't
incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
```

##### Actions

```
Multiattack. The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.
Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15

**Bandits** rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or
spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or
famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.
**Pirates** are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested
only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the
crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.

 _Hit:

3) piercing damage.

##### Reactions

```
Parry. The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit
it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee
weapon.
```

```
It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a
gang of bandits in line. The bandit captain has these qualities in spades. In
addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a
variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep
the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a
regular basis. More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves
infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely
to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know
anything of the captain's colorful reputation.

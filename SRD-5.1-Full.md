# Magic Items

Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of
conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost
vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character
could rarely have otherwise, or they complement
their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways.

## Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond
with them before their magical properties can be
used. This bond is called attunement, and certain
items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is
a class, a creature must be a member of that class to
attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class,
a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that
class's spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a
spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least
one spell using its traits or features, not using a
magic item or the like.
Without becoming attuned to an item that
requires attunement, a creature gains only its
nonmagical benefits, unless its description states
otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires
attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield
to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical
properties.
Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a
short rest focused on only that item while being in
physical contact with it (this can't be the same short
rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus
can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon),
meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other
appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted,
the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end
of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive
understanding of how to activate any magical
properties of the item, including any necessary
command words.
An item can be attuned to only one creature at a
time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than
three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to
a fourth item fails; the creature must end its
attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature
can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For
example, a creature can't attune to more than one
_ring of protection_ at a time.
A creature's attunement to an item ends if the
creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for
attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet
away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if
another creature attunes to the item. A creature can

```
also voluntarily end attunement by spending
another short rest focused on the item, unless the
item is cursed.
```
## Wearing and Wielding Items

```
Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing
or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must
be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the
feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the
head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be
donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak
fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be
held.
In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be
worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build.
Many magic garments are made to be easily
adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to
the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story
suggests a good reason for an item to fit only
creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that
it doesn't adjust. For example, drow-made armor
might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items
usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk.
When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use
your discretion as to whether the item functions as
intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but
a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't
wear boots.
```
### Multiple Items of the Same Kind

```
Use common sense to determine whether more than
one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A
character can't normally wear more than one pair of
footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of
bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear,
and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character
might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for
example, or to layer two cloaks.
```
### Paired Items

```
Items that come in pairs--such as boots, bracers,
gauntlets, and gloves--impart their benefits only if
both items of the pair are worn. For example, a
character wearing a boot of striding and springing
on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot
gains no benefit from either.
```
## Activating an Item

```
Activating some magic items requires a user to do
something special, such as holding the item and
uttering a command word. The description of each
```

item category or individual item details how an item
is activated. Certain items use the following rules for
their activation.
If an item requires an action to activate, that
action isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a
feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used
to activate the item.

### Command Word

A command word is a word or phrase that must be
spoken for an item to work. A magic item that
requires a command word can't be activated in an
area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the
silence spell.

### Consumables

Some items are used up when they are activated. A
potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil
applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a
scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item
loses its magic.

### Spells

Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell
level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and
requires no components, unless the item's
description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal
casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the
item must concentrate if the spell requires
concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass
the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects,
with their usual duration. Certain items make
exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time,
duration, or other parts of a spell.
A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require
you to use your own spellcasting ability when you
cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one
spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use
with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting
ability--perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic
Device feature--your spellcasting ability modifier is
+0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does
apply.

### Charges

Some magic items have charges that must be
expended to activate their properties. The number of
charges an item has remaining is revealed when an
identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature
attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains

```
charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many
charges it regained.
```
## Magic Items A-Z

```
Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A
magic item's description gives the item's name, its
category, its rarity, and its magical properties.
```
#### Adamantine Armor

```
Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon
This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine,
one of the hardest substances in existence. While
you're wearing it, any critical hit against you
becomes a normal hit.
```
#### Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3

```
Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare
(+2), or very rare (+3)
You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made
with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is
determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it
hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.
```
#### Amulet of Health

```
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this
amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is
already 19 or higher.
```
#### Amulet of Proof against Detection and

#### Location

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from
divination magic. You can't be targeted by such
magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.
```
#### Amulet of the Planes

```
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to
name a location that you are familiar with on
another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15
Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast
the
 plane shift spell. On a failure, you and each
creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a
random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1-60, you
travel to a random location on the plane you named.
On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined
plane of existence.
```

#### Animated Shield

_Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)_

While holding this shield, you can speak its
command word as a bonus action to cause it to
animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in
your space to protect you as if you were wielding it,
leaving your hands free. The shield remains
animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action
to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or
die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or
into your hand if you have one free.

#### Apparatus of the Crab

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron
barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden
catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20
Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the
catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel,
allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl
inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each
in a neutral position, able to move either up or down.
When certain levers are used, the apparatus
transforms to resemble a giant lobster.
The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with
the following statistics:

**Armor Class:** 20
**Hit Points:** 200
**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs
and tail aren't extended)
**Damage Immunities:
** poison, psychic

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one
pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the
compartment is airtight and watertight. The
compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of
breathing, divided by the number of breathing
creatures inside.
The apparatus floats on water. It can also go
underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the
vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute
from pressure.
A creature in the compartment can use an action
to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up
or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its
neutral position. Each lever, from left to right,
functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab
Levers table.

#### Armor, +1, +2, or +3

```
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare
(+2), or legendary (+3)
You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor.
The bonus is determined by its rarity.
```
#### Armor of Invulnerability

```
Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)
You have resistance to nonmagical damage while
you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an
action to make yourself immune to nonmagical
damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer
wearing the armor. Once this special action is used,
it can't be used again until the next dawn.
```
#### Armor of Resistance

```
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires
attunement)
You have resistance to one type of damage while you
wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or
determines it randomly from the options below.
```

**d10 Damage Type d10 Damage Type**

#### Armor of Vulnerability

_Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to
one of the following damage types: bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or
determines it randomly.
**_Curse._** This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed
only when an
 _identify_ spell is cast on the armor or
you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you
until you are targeted by the
 _remove curse_ spell or
similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the
curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of
the three damage types associated with the armor
(not the one to which it grants resistance).

#### Arrow-Catching Shield

_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks
while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition
to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition,
whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against
a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your
reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

#### Arrow of Slaying

_Weapon (arrow), very rare_

An
 _arrow of slaying_ is a magic weapon meant to slay
a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused
than others; for example, there are both
 _arrows of
dragon slaying_ and
 _arrows of blue dragon slaying_ . If a
creature belonging to the type, race, or group
associated with an
 _arrow of slaying_ takes damage
from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17
Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10
piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much
extra damage on a successful one.
Once an
 _arrow of slaying_ deals its extra damage to
a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.
Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist,
such as
 _bolts of slaying_ meant for a crossbow, though
arrows are most common.

#### Bag of Beans

```
Wondrous item, rare
Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The
bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean
it contains.
If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground,
they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the
beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects
in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt
or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an
effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was
planted. The GM can choose an effect from the
following table, determine it randomly, or create an
effect.
d100 Effect
01
 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a
toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become
poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater
gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
02 - 10
 A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry
juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM's choice) 30
feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.
11 - 20
 A treant sprouts. There's a 50 percent chance
that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks.
21 - 30
 An animate, immobile stone statue in your
likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against
you. If you leave it and others come near, it
describes you as the most heinous of villains and
directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If
you are on the same plane of existence as the
statue, it knows where you are. The statue
becomes inanimate after 24 hours.
31 - 40
 A campfire with blue flames springs forth and
burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished).
41 - 50
 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout
51 - 60
 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever
a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or
smaller monster of the GM's choice. The
monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears
in a puff of bright pink smoke.
61 - 70
 A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks.
71 - 80
 A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of
which act as randomly determined magic
potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of
the GM's choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour.
Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30
days.
81 - 90
 A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature
```

```
that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution
saving throw. On a successful save, a creature
permanently increases its lowest ability score by
1, randomly choosing among equally low scores.
On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force
damage from an internal magical explosion.
91- 99
 A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts
upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a
mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the
mummy lord's lair, and its sarcophagus contains
treasure of the GM's choice.
00
 A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of
the GM's choice. The top leads where the GM
chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant's
castle, or a different plane of existence.
```
#### Bag of Devouring

_Wondrous item, very rare_

This bag superficially resembles a
 _bag of holding
_ but
is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional
creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the
orifice.
The extradimensional creature attached to the bag
can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal
or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is
devoured and lost forever. When part of a living
creature is placed in the bag, as happens when
someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent
chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A
creature inside the bag can use its action to try to
escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check.
Another creature can use its action to reach into the
bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful
DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside
the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside
the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.
Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which
can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once
each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and
spits them out into another plane of existence. The
GM determines the time and plane.
If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and
anything contained within it is transported to a
random location on the Astral Plane.

#### Bag of Holding

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This bag has an interior space considerably larger
than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in
diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can
hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64
cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of

```
its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag
requires an action.
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it
ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are
scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned
inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the
bag must be put right before it can be used again.
Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to
a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the
number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after
which time they begin to suffocate.
Placing a
 bag of holding inside an
extradimensional space created by a
 handy
haversack ,
 portable hole , or similar item instantly
destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral
Plane. The gate originates where the one item was
placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet
of the gate is sucked through it to a random location
on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is
one-way only and can't be reopened.
```
#### Bag of Tricks

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth,
appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however,
reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag
weighs 1/2 pound.
You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from
the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object
lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by
rolling a d8 and consulting the table that
corresponds to the bag's color. The creature
vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0
hit points.
The creature is friendly to you and your
companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a
bonus action to command how the creature moves
and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it
general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In
the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a
fashion appropriate to its nature.
Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from
the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next
dawn.

#### Bead of Force

_Wondrous item, rare_

This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in
diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4
_beads of force_ are found together.
You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60
feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed.
Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the
bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of
transparent force then encloses the area for 1
minute. Any creature that failed the save and is
completely within the area is trapped inside this
sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are
partially within the area, are pushed away from the
center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it.
Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's
wall. No attack or other effect can.
An enclosed creature can use its action to push
against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to
half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be
picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1
pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

#### Belt of Dwarvenkind

```
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
While wearing this belt, you gain the following
benefits:
```
- Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a
 maximum of 20.
- You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion)
 checks made to interact with dwarves.
In addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50
percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full
beard if you're capable of growing one, or a visibly
thicker beard if you already have one.
If you aren't a dwarf, you gain the following
additional benefits while wearing the belt:
- You have advantage on saving throws against
 poison, and you have resistance against poison
 damage.
- You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.

#### Belt of Giant Strength

```
Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)
While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes
to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is
already equal to or greater than the belt's score, the
item has no effect on you.
Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with
and having rarity according to the six kinds of true
giants. The
 belt of stone giant strength and the
 belt of
frost giant strength look different, but they have the
same effect.

#### Berserker Axe

```
Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you
are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum
increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
Curse. This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to
it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain
cursed, you are unwilling to part with the axe,
keeping it within reach at all times. You also have
disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other
```

than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you
that you can see or hear.
Whenever a hostile creature damages you while
the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a
DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While
berserk, you must use your action each round to
attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If
you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack
action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack
the next nearest creature after you fell your current
target. If you have multiple possible targets, you
attack one at random. You are berserk until you start
your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you
that you can see or hear.

#### Boots of Elvenkind

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

While you wear these boots, your steps make no
sound, regardless of the surface you are moving
across. You also have advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.

#### Boots of Levitation

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

While you wear these boots, you can use an action to
cast the
 _levitate_ spell on yourself at will.

#### Boots of Speed

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus
action and click the boots' heels together. If you do,
the boots double your walking speed, and any
creature that makes an opportunity attack against
you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click
your heels together again, you end the effect.
When the boots' property has been used for a total
of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you
finish a long rest.

#### Boots of Striding and Springing

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While you wear these boots, your walking speed
becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher,
and your speed isn't reduced if you are encumbered
or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump
three times the normal distance, though you can't
jump farther than your remaining movement would
allow.

#### Boots of the Winterlands

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
These furred boots are snug and feel quite warm.
While you wear them, you gain the following
benefits:
```
- You have resistance to cold damage.
- You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.
- You can tolerate temperatures as low as -50
 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional
 protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can
 tolerate temperatures as low as -100 degrees
 Fahrenheit.

#### Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals

```
Wondrous item, rare
While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an
action to speak the bowl's command word and
summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the
conjure elemental spell. The bowl can't be used this
way again until the next dawn.
The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as
deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
```
#### Bracers of Archery

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While wearing these bracers, you have proficiency
with the longbow and shortbow, and you gain a +2
bonus to damage rolls on ranged attacks made with
such weapons.
```
#### Bracers of Defense

```
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
While wearing these bracers, you gain a +2 bonus to
AC if you are wearing no armor and using no shield.
```
#### Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals

```
Wondrous item, rare
While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use
an action to speak the brazier's command word and
summon a fire elemental, as if you had cast the
conjure elemental spell. The brazier can't be used
this way again until the next dawn.
The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
```
#### Brooch of Shielding

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While wearing this brooch, you have resistance to
force damage, and you have immunity to damage
from the
 magic missile spell.
```

#### Broom of Flying

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds,
functions like a mundane broom until you stand
astride it and speak its command word. It then
hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It
has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400
pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while
carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops
hovering when you land.
You can send the broom to travel alone to a
destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the
command word, name the location, and are familiar
with that place. The broom comes back to you when
you speak another command word, provided that
the broom is still within 1 mile of you.

#### Candle of Invocation

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares
that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be
detected with the _detect evil and good_ spell. The GM
chooses the god and associated alignment or
determines the alignment randomly.

```
d20 Alignment
1 - 2
 Chaotic evil
3 - 4
 Chaotic neutral
5 - 7
 Chaotic good
8-9
 Neutral evil
10 - 11
 Neutral
12- 13
 Neutral good
14- 15
 Lawful evil
16- 17
 Lawful neutral
18- 20
 Lawful good
```
The candle's magic is activated when the candle is
lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4
hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out
early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it
burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's
total burn time.
While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot
radius. Any creature within that light whose
alignment matches that of the candle makes attack
rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with
advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light
whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-
level spells he or she has prepared without
expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if
cast with a 1st-level slot.

```
Alternatively, when you light the candle for the
first time, you can cast the
 gate spell with it. Doing so
destroys the candle.
```
#### Cape of the Mountebank

```
Wondrous item, rare
This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing
it, you can use it to cast the
 dimension door spell as
an action. This property of the cape can't be used
again until the next dawn.
When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of
smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at
your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the
space you left and the space you appear in, and it
dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or
stronger wind disperses the smoke.
```
#### Carpet of Flying

```
Wondrous item, very rare
You can speak the carpet's command word as an
action to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves
according to your spoken directions, provided that
you are within 30 feet of it.
Four sizes of
 carpet of flying exist. The GM chooses
the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly.
d100
 Size Capacity Flying Speed
01- 20
 3 ft. [x] 5 ft. 200 lb. 80
 feet
21- 55
 4 ft. [x] 6 ft. 400 lb. 60 feet
56- 80
 5 ft. [x] 7 ft. 600 lb. 40 feet
81 - 100
 6 ft. [x] 9 ft. 800 lb. 30 feet
```

```
A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown
on the table, but it flies at half speed if it carries
more than its normal capacity.
```
#### Censer of Controlling Air Elementals

```
Wondrous item, rare
While incense is burning in this censer, you can use
an action to speak the censer's command word and
summon an air elemental, as if you had cast the
conjure elemental spell. The censer can't be used this
way again until the next dawn.
This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot-high vessel resembles a
chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound.
```
#### Chime of Opening

```
Wondrous item, rare
This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long
and weighs 1 pound. You can strike it as an action,
pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that
can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime
```

issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the
object opens unless the sound can't reach the object.
If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens.
The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth
time, it cracks and becomes useless.

#### Circlet of Blasting

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to
cast the
 _scorching ray_ spell with it. When you make
the spell's attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of
+5. The circlet can't be used this way again until the
next dawn.

#### Cloak of Arachnida

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven
with faint silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain
the following benefits:

- You have resistance to poison damage.
- You have a climbing speed equal to your walking
 speed.
- You can move up, down, and across vertical
 surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while
 leaving your hands free.
- You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can
 move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.
- You can use an action to cast the
 _web
_ spell (save
 DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its
 normal area. Once used, this property of the cloak
 can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Cloak of Displacement

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that
makes you appear to be standing in a place near
your actual location, causing any creature to have
disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take
damage, the property ceases to function until the
start of your next turn. This property is suppressed
while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise
unable to move.

#### Cloak of Elvenkind

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom
(Perception) checks made to see you have
disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color

```
shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or
down requires an action.
```
#### Cloak of Protection

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while
you wear this cloak.
```
#### Cloak of the Bat

```
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In an area of dim light or
darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak with
both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If
you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in
this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or
darkness, you lose this flying speed.
While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or
darkness, you can use your action to cast
 polymorph
on yourself, transforming into a bat. While you are in
the form of the bat, you retain your Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be
used this way again until the next dawn.
```
#### Cloak of the Manta Ray

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
While wearing this cloak with its hood up, you can
breathe underwater, and you have a swimming
speed of 60 feet. Pulling the hood up or down
requires an action.
```
#### Crystal Ball

```
Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires
attunement)
The typical
 crystal ball , a very rare item, is about 6
inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast
the
 scrying spell (save DC 17) with it.
The following
 crystal ball variants are legendary
items and have additional properties.
Crystal Ball of Mind Reading. You can use an
action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 17)
while you are scrying with the
 crystal ball , targeting
creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's
sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this
 detect
thoughts to maintain it during its duration, but it
ends if
 scrying
 ends.
Crystal Ball of Telepathy. While scrying with the
crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with
creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's
sensor. You can also use an action to cast the
suggestion spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on
```

one of those creatures. You don't need to
concentrate on this
 _suggestion_ to maintain it during
its duration, but it ends if
 _scrying
_ ends. Once used,
the
 _suggestion_ power of the
 _crystal ball_ can't be used
again until the next dawn.
**_Crystal Ball of True Seeing.
_** While scrying with
the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of
120 feet centered on the spell's sensor.

#### Cube of Force

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a
distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube
starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended
charges daily at dawn.
You can use an action to press one of the cube's
faces, expending a number of charges based on the
chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces
table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has
insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens.
Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into
existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The
barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts
for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the
cube's sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges.
You can change the barrier's effect by pressing a
different face of the cube and expending the
requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.
If your movement causes the barrier to come into
contact with a solid object that can't pass through
the cube, you can't move any closer to that object as
long as the barrier remains.

#### Cube of Force Faces

certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the
table below.

```

Horn of blasting 1d10
Passwall 1d6
Prismatic spray 1d20

```
#### Cubic Gate

```
Wondrous item, legendary
This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable
magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each
keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which
is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to
planes determined by the GM.
You can use an action to press one side of the cube
to cast the
 gate spell with it, opening a portal to the
plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an
action to press one side twice, you can cast the
 plane
shift spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport
the targets to the plane keyed to that side.
The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube
expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended
charges daily at dawn.
```
#### Dagger of Venom

```
Weapon (dagger), rare
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
You can use an action to cause thick, black poison
to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute
or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature.
That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and
become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can't be
used this way again until the next dawn.
```
#### Dancing Sword

```
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)
You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword
into the air and speak the command word. When you
do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet,
and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet
of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability
score modifier to damage rolls.
While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus
action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot
within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus
action, you can cause the sword to attack one
creature within 5 feet of it.
After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth
time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your
hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground
```

at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path
to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then
falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you
grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.

#### Decanter of Endless Water

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it
contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.
You can use an action to remove the stopper and
speak one of three command words, whereupon an
amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice)
pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at
the start of your next turn. Choose from the
following options:

- "Stream" produces 1 gallon of water.
- "Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water.
- "Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes
 forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a
 bonus action while holding the decanter, you can
 aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30
 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13
 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning
 damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you
 can target an object that isn't being worn or
 carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds.
 The object is either knocked over or pushed up to
 15 feet away from you.

#### Deck of Illusions

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full
deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is
usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.
The magic of the deck functions only if cards are
dra wn at random (you can use an altered deck of
playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an
action to draw a card at random from the deck and
throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of
you.
An illusion of one or more creatures forms over
the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An
illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate
size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except
that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet
of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an
action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet
of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory
creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects
pass through it. Someone who uses an action to
visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory

```
with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
check. The creature then appears translucent.
The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the
illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the
image on its card disappears, and that card can't be
used again.

#### Deck of Many Things

```
Wondrous item, legendary
Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a
number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75
percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but
the rest have twenty-two.
Before you draw a card, you must declare how
many cards you intend to draw and then draw them
randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing
cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in
excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as
```

soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic
takes effect. You must draw each card no more than
1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw
the chosen number, the remaining number of cards
fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at
once.
Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence.
Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card
reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the
same card twice.

*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards

**_Balance._** Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration,
causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes
chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are
true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on
you.
**_Comet._** If you single-handedly defeat the next
hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter,
you gain experience points enough to gain one level.
Otherwise, this card has no effect.
**_Donjon._** You disappear and become entombed in a
state of suspended animation in an extradimensional
sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying
stays behind in the space you occupied when you
disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are
found and removed from the sphere. You can't be
located by any divination magic, but a
 _wish_ spell can
reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more
cards.

```
Euryale. The card's medusa-like visage curses you.
You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed
in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates
card can end this curse.
The Fates. Reality's fabric unravels and spins
anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if
it never happened. You can use the card's magic as
soon as you draw the card or at any other time
before you die.
Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy.
The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life,
savoring your suffering before attempting to slay
you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil
dies.
Fool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and
draw from the deck again, counting both draws as
one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP
would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an
amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep
your level.
Gem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000
gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at
your feet.
Idiot. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by
1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one
additional card beyond your declared draws.
Jester. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two
additional cards beyond your declared draws.
Key. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you
are proficient appears in your hands. The GM
chooses the weapon.
Knight. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter
who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of
you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves
you loyally until death, believing the fates have
drawn him or her to you. You control this character.
Moon. You are granted the ability to cast the
 wish
spell 1d3 times.
Rogue. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice
becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your
new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone
else reveals it. Nothing less than a
 wish spell or
divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility
toward you.
Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own,
other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable
property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land
you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least.
Any documentation that proves you should own
something lost to this card also disappears.
Skull. You summon an avatar of death--a ghostly
humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and
carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of
```

the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you,
warning all others that you must win the battle alone.
The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit
points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to
help you, the helper summons its own avatar of
death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be
restored to life.

#### Avatar of Death

_Medium undead, neutral evil_

**Armor Class** 20

**Hit Points** half the hit point maximum of its summoner

**Speed** 60 ft., fly 60 ft. (hover)

petrified, poisoned, unconscious

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., truesight 60 ft., passive
Perception 13

**Languages** all languages known to its summoner

**Challenge** -- (0 XP)

**_Incorporeal Movement._** The avatar can move through
other creatures and objects as if they were difficult
terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn
inside an object.

**_Turning Immunity._** The avatar is immune to features
that turn undead.

##### Actions

**_Reaping Scythe_****.** The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe
through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 +
3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.

**_Star._** Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The
score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.
**_Sun._** You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item
(which the GM determines randomly) appears in
your hands.
**_Talons.

disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't
destroyed but do vanish.
**_Throne._** You gain proficiency in the Persuasion
skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on
checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain
rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the

```
world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of
monsters, which you must clear out before you can
claim the keep as yours.
Vizier. At any time you choose within one year of
drawing this card, you can ask a question in
meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to
that question. Besides information, the answer helps
you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In
other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on
how to apply it.
The Void. This black card spells disaster. Your soul
is drawn from your body and contained in an object
in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful
beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in
this way, your body is incapacitated. A
 wish spell
can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the
location of the object that holds it. You draw no more
cards.
```
#### Defender

```
Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires
attunement)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
The first time you attack with the sword on each of
your turns, you can transfer some or all of the
sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using
the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you
could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage
rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted
bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next
turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a
bonus to AC from it.
```
#### Demon Armor

```
Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)
While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC,
and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In
addition, the armor's clawed gauntlets turn unarmed
strikes with your hands into magic weapons that
deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls
and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.
Curse. Once you don this cursed armor, you can't
doff it unless you are targeted by the
 remove curse
spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you
have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons
and on saving throws against their spells and special
abilities.
```

#### Dimensional Shackles

_Wondrous item, rare_

You can use an action to place these shackles on an
incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a
creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving
as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a
creature bound by them from using any method of
extradimensional movement, including teleportation
or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't
prevent the creature from passing through an
interdimensional portal.
You and any creature you designate when you use
the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once
every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30
Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature
breaks free and destroys the shackles.

#### Dragon Scale Mail

_Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)_

Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of
dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off
scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times,
hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a
dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is
highly valued.
While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to
AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the
Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons,
and you have resistance to one damage type that is
determined by the kind of dragon that provided the
scales (see the table).
Additionally, you can focus your senses as an
action to magically discern the distance and
direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of
you that is of the same type as the armor. This
special action can't be used again until the next
dawn.

**Dragon Resistance Dragon Resistance**
Black Acid
 Gold Fire
Blue Lightning Green Poison
Brass Fire Red
 Fire
Bronze Lightning Silver Cold
Copper Acid
 White Cold

#### Dragon Slayer

_Weapon (any sword), rare_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the
dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon's
type. For the purpose of this weapon, "dragon"

```
refers to any creature with the dragon type,
including dragon turtles and wyverns.
```
#### Dust of Disappearance

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very
fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When
you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you
and each creature and object within 10 feet of you
become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is
the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed
when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by
the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends
for that creature.
```
#### Dust of Dryness

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust.
You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over
water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a
side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or
rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's
weight is negligible.
Someone can use an action to smash the pellet
against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter
and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so
ends that pellet's magic.
An elemental composed mostly of water that is
exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13
Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
```
#### Dust of Sneezing and Choking

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
Found in a small container, this powder resembles
very fine sand. It appears to be
 dust of disappearance ,
and an
 identify spell reveals it to be such. There is
enough of it for one use.
When you use an action to throw a handful of the
dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to
breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC
15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to
breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature
affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating.
As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on it on a success. The
 lesser restoration
spell can also end the effect on a creature.
```

#### Dwarven Plate

_Armor (plate), very rare_

While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC.
In addition, if an effect moves you against your will
along the ground, you can use your reaction to
reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.

#### Dwarven Thrower

_Weapon (warhammer), very rare (requires
attunement by a dwarf)_

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown
property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long
range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack
using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if
the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after
the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.

#### Efficient Quiver

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to
an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to
hold numerous items while never weighing more
than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold
up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The
midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins
or similar objects. The longest compartment holds
up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or
spears.
You can draw any item the quiver contains as if
doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.

#### Efreeti Bottle

_Wondrous item, very rare_

This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you
use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick
smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn,
the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire,
and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space
within 30 feet of you.
The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to
determine what happens.

```
d100
 Effect
01- 10
 The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5
rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle
loses its magic.
11 - 90
 The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you
command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle,
and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't
be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the
bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the
```

```
bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti
escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its
magic.
91 - 00
 The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for
you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or
after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.
```
#### Elemental Gem

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When
you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is
summoned as if you had cast the
 conjure elemental
spell, and the gem's magic is lost. The type of gem
determines the elemental summoned by the spell.
Gem Summoned Elemental
Blue sapphire
 Air elemental
Yellow diamond Earth elemental
Red corundum Fire elemental
Emerald
 Water elemental
```
#### Elven Chain

```
Armor (chain shirt), rare
You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor.
You are considered proficient with this armor even if
you lack proficiency with medium armor.
```
#### Eversmoking Bottle

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this
brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use
an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick
smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle.
The cloud's area is heavily obscured. Each minute
the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the
radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its
maximum radius of 120 feet.
The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open.
Closing the bottle requires you to speak its
command word as an action. Once the bottle is
closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A
moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also
disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong
wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1
round.
```
#### Eyes of Charming

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3
charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1
charge as an action to cast the
 charm person spell
```

(save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you,
provided that you and the target can see each other.
The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Eyes of Minute Seeing

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing
them, you can see much better than normal out to a
range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence
(Investigation) checks that rely on sight while
searching an area or studying an object within that
range.

#### Eyes of the Eagle

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing
them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear
visibility, you can make out details of even extremely
distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet
across.

#### Feather Token

_Wondrous item, rare_

This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types
of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-
use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or
determines it randomly.

**d100
 Feather Token
 d100
 Feather Token
**
01 - 20
 Anchor 51 - 65
 Swan boat
21 - 35
 Bird 66 - 90
 Tree
36 - 50
 Fan 91 - 00
 Whip

**_Anchor._** You can use an action to touch the token
to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel
can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to
the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends,
the token disappears.
**_Bird._** You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet
into the air. The token disappears and an enormous,
multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the
statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple
commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500
pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles
an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a
one -hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000
pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after
flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to
0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.
**_Fan._** If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an
action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The

```
token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its
place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong
enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its
speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can
dismiss the fan as an action.
Swan Boat. You can use an action to touch the
token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter.
The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-
wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The
boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a
speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action
while on the boat to command it to move or to turn
up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two
Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature
counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge
creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24
hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat
as an action.
Tree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You
can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space
on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place
a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The
tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk,
and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot
radius.
Whip. You can use an action to throw the token to
a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears,
and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use
a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a
creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack
bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force
damage.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the
whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack
against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip
disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to
dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.
```
#### Figurine of Wondrous Power

```
Wondrous item, rarity by figurine
A
 figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast
small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to
speak the command word and throw the figurine to
a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the
figurine becomes a living creature. If the space
where the creature would appear is occupied by
other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough
space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a
creature.
The creature is friendly to you and your
companions. It understands your languages and
obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no
```

commands, the creature defends itself but takes no
other actions.
The creature exists for a duration specific to each
figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature
reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine
early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action
to speak the command word again while touching it.
When the creature becomes a figurine again, its
property can't be used again until a certain amount
of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's
description.
**_Bronze Griffon (Rare)._** This bronze statuette is of
a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6
hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again
until 5 days have passed.
**_Ebony Fly (Rare).
_** This ebony statuette is carved
in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly
for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount.
Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2
days have passed.

#### Giant Fly

**Languages** --

**_Golden Lions (Rare)._** These gold statuettes of
lions are always created in pairs. You can use one
figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a
lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it
can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
**_Ivory Goats (Rare)._** These ivory statuettes of
goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat
looks unique and functions differently from the
others. Their properties are as follows:

- The
 _goat of traveling_ can become a Large goat with
 the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24
 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it
 spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has
 charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When
 it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and
 can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when
 it regains all its charges.
 - The
 _goat of travail_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3
 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again
 until 30 days have passed.
 - The
 _goat of terror_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3
 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove
 its horns and use them as weapons. One horn
 becomes a
 _+1 lance_ , and the other becomes a _+2_
 _longsword_ . Removing a horn requires an action,
 and the weapons disappear and the horns return
 when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition,
 the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror
 while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you
 that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a
 DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of
 the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to
 figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat
 the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
 ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it
 successfully saves against the effect, a creature is
 immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours.
 Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used
 again until 15 days have passed.
 **_Marble Elephant (Rare)._** This marble statuette is
 about 4 inches high and long. It can become an
 elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it
 can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
 **_Obsidian Steed (Very Rare)._** This polished
 obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24
 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself.
 Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5
 days have passed.
 If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10
 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your
 orders, including a command to revert to figurine
 form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring
 your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly
 transported to a random location on the plane of
 Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.
 **_Onyx Dog (Rare)._** This onyx statuette of a dog can
 become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has
 an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also
 has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see
 invisible creatures and objects within that range.
 Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7
 days have passed.
 **_Serpentine Owl (Rare)._** This serpentine statuette
 of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours.
 Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2
 days have passed. The owl can telepathically
 communicate with you at any range if you and it are
 on the same plane of existence.
 **_Silver Raven (Uncommon)._** This silver statuette of
 a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once


it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days
have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows
you to cast the
 _animal messenger_ spell on it at will.

#### Flame Tongue

_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_

You can use a bonus action to speak this magic
sword's command word, causing flames to erupt
from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a
40- foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet.
While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire
damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you
use a bonus action to speak the command word
again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

#### Folding Boat

_Wondrous item, rare_

This object appears as a wooden box that measures
12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It
weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store
items inside. This item also has three command
words, each requiring you to use an action to speak
it.
One command word causes the box to unfold into
a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The
boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a
lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium
creatures comfortably.
The second command word causes the box to
unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet
deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of
oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a
mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen
Medium creatures comfortably.
When the box becomes a vessel, its weight
becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and
anything that was stored in the box remains in the
boat.
The third command word causes the _ folding boat_
to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures
are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit
inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any
objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

#### Frost Brand

_Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)_

When you hit with an attack using this magic sword,
the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. In
addition, while you hold the sword, you have
resistance to fire damage.

```
In freezing temperatures, the blade sheds bright
light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an
additional 10 feet.
When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish
all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you. This
property can be used no more than once per hour.

#### Gem of Brightness

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it,
you can use an action to speak one of three
command words to cause one of the following
effects:
```
- The first command word causes the gem to shed
 bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an
 additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a
 charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to
 repeat the command word or until you use
 another function of the gem.
- The second command word expends 1 charge and
 causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at
 one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The
 creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
 saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The
 creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
 each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
 success.
- The third command word expends 5 charges and
 causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-
 foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the
 cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the
 beam created with the second command word.
When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem
becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.

#### Gem of Seeing

the gem's command word and expend 1 charge. For

```

#### Giant Slayer

_Weapon (any axe or sword), rare_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
When you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an
extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall
prone. For the purpose of this weapon, "giant" refers
to any creature with the giant type, including ettins
and trolls.

#### Glamoured Studded Leather

_Armor (studded leather), rare_

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
You can also use a bonus action to speak the armor's
command word and cause the armor to assume the
appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other
kind of armor. You decide what it looks like,
including color, style, and accessories, but the armor
retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory
appearance lasts until you use this property again or
remove the armor.

#### Gloves of Missile Snaring

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands
when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack
hits you while you're wearing them, you can use
your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your
Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free
hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch
the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that
hand.

#### Gloves of Swimming and Climbing

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming
don't cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5
bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb
or swim.

#### Goggles of Night

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

While wearing these dark lenses, you have
darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already

range by 60 feet.

#### Hammer of Thunderbolts

```
Weapon (maul), legendary
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
Giant's Bane (Requires Attunement). You must
be wearing a
 belt of giant strength (any variety) and
gauntlets of ogre power to attune to this weapon. The
attunement ends if you take off either of those items.
While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it,
your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed
20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll
made with this weapon against a giant, the giant
must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw
or die.
The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to
it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged
weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it
had the thrown property with a normal range of 20
feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the
hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300
feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of
it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving
throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily

```
#### Handy Haversack

```
Wondrous item, rare
This backpack has a central pouch and two side
pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space.
Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of
material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The
large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80
pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5
pounds, regardless of its contents.
Placing an object in the haversack follows the
normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving
an item from the haversack requires you to use an
action. When you reach into the haversack for a
specific item, the item is always magically on top.
The haversack has a few limitations. If it is
overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it,
the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the
haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever,
although an artifact always turns up again
somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its
contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack
must be put right before it can be used again. If a
breathing creature is placed within the haversack,
the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after
which time it begins to suffocate.
```

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional
space created by a
 _bag of holding_ ,
 _portable hole_ , or
similar item instantly destroys both items and opens
a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where
the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through
it and deposited in a random location on the Astral
Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only
and can't be reopened.

#### Hat of Disguise

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast
the
 _disguise self
_ spell from it at will. The spell ends if
the hat is removed.

#### Headband of Intellect

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

Your Intelligence score is 19 while you wear this
headband. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence
is already 19 or higher.

#### Helm of Brilliance

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10
rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem
pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the
gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its
magic.
You gain the following benefits while wearing it:

- You can use an action to cast one of the following
 spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems
 of the specified type as a component:
 _daylight_
 (opal),
 _fireball_ (fire opal),
 _prismatic spray_
 (diamond), or
 _wall of fire_ (ruby). The gem is
 destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears
 from the helm.
- As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm
 emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least
 one undead is within that area. Any undead that
 starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant
 damage.
- As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have
 resistance to fire damage.
- As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you
 can use an action and speak a command word to
 cause one weapon you are holding to burst into
 flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot
 radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The
 flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When
 you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon,

```
the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The
flames last until you use a bonus action to speak
the command word again or until you drop or
stow the weapon.
Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take
fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw
against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams
of light from its remaining gems. Each creature
within 60 feet of the helm other than you must
succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be
struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the
number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems
are then destroyed.
```
#### Helm of Comprehending Languages

```
#### Helm of Telepathy

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

cast the
 detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. As
long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you
can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message
to a creature you are focused on. It can reply--using
a bonus action to do so--while your focus on it
continues.
While focusing on a creature with
 detect thoughts ,
you can use an action to cast the
 suggestion
 spell
(save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once
used, the
 suggestion property can't be used again
until the next dawn.
```
#### Helm of Teleportation

by a paladin)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend
or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra
2d10 radiant damage.
While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an
aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all
creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage
```

on saving throws against spells and other magical
effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin
cla ss, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.

#### Horn of Blasting

_Wondrous item, rare_

You can use an action to speak the horn's command
word and then blow the horn, which emits a
thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible
600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened
for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes
half as much damage and isn't deafened. Creatures
and objects made of glass or crystal have
disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6
thunder damage instead of 5d6.
Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent
chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion
deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys
the horn.

#### Horn of Valhalla

_Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare
(bronze), or legendary (iron)_

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response,
warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60
feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker_._
They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they
drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't
be used again until 7 days have passed.
Four types of
 _horn of Valhalla_ are known to exist,
each made of a different metal. The horn's type
determines how many berserkers answer its
summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The
GM chooses the horn's type or determines it
randomly.

```
d100
 Horn

If you blow the horn without meeting its
requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you.
If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you
and your companions and follow your commands.

#### Horseshoes of a Zephyr

```
Wondrous item, very rare
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While
all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or
similar creature, they allow the creature to move
normally while floating 4 inches above the ground.
This effect means the creature can cross or stand
above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water
or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores
difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move
at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without
suffering exhaustion from a forced march.
```
#### Horseshoes of Speed

```
Wondrous item, rare
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While
all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or
similar creature, they increase the creature's
walking speed by 30 feet.
```
#### Immovable Rod

```
Rod, uncommon
This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can
use an action to press the button, which causes the
rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or
another creature uses an action to push the button
again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying
gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of
weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate
and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC
30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet
on a success.
```
#### Instant Fortress

```
Wondrous item, rare
You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube
on the ground and speak its command word. The
cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until
you use an action to speak the command word that
dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is
empty.
The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side
and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a
battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two
floors, with a ladder running along one wall to
connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading
to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small
door on the side facing you. The door opens only at
your command, which you can speak as a bonus
action. It is immune to the
 knock spell and similar
magic, such as that of a chime of opening.
```

Each creature in the area where the fortress
appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one. In either
case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space
outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area
that aren't being worn or carried take this damage
and are pushed automatically.
The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic
prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the
door, and the walls each have 100 hit points,
immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons
excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other
damage. Only a
 _wish_ spell can repair the fortress
(this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of
8th level or lower). Each casting of _ wish_ causes the
roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.

#### Ioun Stone

_Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)_

An
 _Ioun stone_ is named after Ioun, a god of
knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds.
Many types of
 _Ioun stone_ exist, each type a distinct
combination of shape and color.
When you use an action to toss one of these stones
into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance
of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter,
another creature must use an action to grasp or net
the stone to separate it from you, either by making a
successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful
DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an
action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.
A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to
all damage. It is considered to be an object that is
being worn while it orbits your head.
**_Absorption (Very Rare)._** While this pale lavender
elli psoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction
to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a
creature you can see and targeting only you.
Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it
burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you
are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the
number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone
can't cancel it.
**_Agility (Very Rare)._** Your Dexterity score
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep
red sphere orbits your head.
**_Awareness (Rare)._** You can't be surprised while
this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.
**_Fortitude (Very Rare)._** Your Constitution score
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink
rhomboid orbits your head.

```
Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this
marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your
head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of
8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and
targeting only you.
Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it
burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you
are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the
number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone
can't cancel it.
Insight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom score
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this
incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.
Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence score
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this
marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.
Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma score
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this
marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.
Mastery (Legendary). Your proficiency bonus
increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits
your head.
Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to AC
while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.
Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 hit
points at the end of each hour this pearly white
spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at
least 1 hit point.
Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores
spells cast into it, holding them until you use them.
The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a
time. When found, it contains 1d4 - 1 levels of
stored spells chosen by the GM.
Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd
level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast.
The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the
stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is
expended without effect. The level of the slot used to
cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any
spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell
save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability
of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if
you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no
longer stored in it, freeing up space.
Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength score
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale
blue rhomboid orbits your head.
Sustenance (Rare). You don't need to eat or drink
while this clear spindle orbits your head.
```

#### Iron Bands of Binding

_Wondrous item, rare_

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in
diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action
to speak the command word and throw the sphere at
a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60
feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it
opens into a tangle of metal bands.
Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus
equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your
proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained
until you take a bonus action to speak the command
word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with
the attack, causes the bands to contract and become
a sphere once more.
A creature, including the one restrained, can use
an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break
the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed,
and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails,
any further attempts made by that creature
automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.
Once the bands are used, they can't be used again
until the next dawn.

#### Iron Flask

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an
action to speak the flask's command word, targeting
a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If
the target is native to a plane of existence other than
the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC
17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask.
If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it
has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a
creature remains in the flask until released. The flask
can hold only one creature at a time. A creature
trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or
drink and doesn't age.
You can use an action to remove the flask's
stopper and release the creature the flask contains.
The creature is friendly to you and your companions
for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that
duration. If you give no commands or give it a
command that is likely to result in its death, it
defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the
end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance
with its normal disposition and alignment.
An
 _identify_ spell reveals that a creature is inside
the flask, but the only way to determine the type of
creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered
bottle might already contain a creature chosen by
the GM or determined randomly.

#### Javelin of Lightning

```
Weapon (javelin), uncommon
This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and
speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of
lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out
from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in
the line excluding you and the target must make a
DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning
damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on
a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a
javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged
weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target
takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning
damage.
The javelin's property can't be used again until the
next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be
used as a magic weapon.
```
#### Lantern of Revealing

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1
pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius
and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible
creatures and objects are visible as long as they are
in the lantern's bright light. You can use an action to
lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-
foot radius.
```

#### Luck Blade

_Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires
attunement)_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on
your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving
throws.
**_Luck.
_** If the sword is on your person, you can call
on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack
roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You
must use the second roll. This property can't be used
again until the next dawn.
**_Wish._** The sword has 1d4 - 1 charges. While
holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge
and cast the
 _wish_ spell from it. This property can't be
used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this
property if it has no charges.

#### Mace of Disruption

_Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)_

When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic
weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant
damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after
taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15
Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a
successful save, the creature becomes frightened of
you until the end of your next turn.
While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in
a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20
feet.

#### Mace of Smiting

_Weapon (mace), rare_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases
to +3 when you use the mace to attack a construct.
When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with
this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6
bludgeoning damage, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage if
it's a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or
fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.

#### Mace of Terror

_Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)_

This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it,
you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release
a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a
30- foot radius extending from you must succeed on
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way,
a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far

```
away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move
to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash
action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it
from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the
creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each
of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw,
ending the effect on itself on a success.
The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn.
```
#### Mantle of Spell Resistance

```
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
You have advantage on saving throws against spells
while you wear this cloak.
```
#### Manual of Bodily Health

```
Wondrous item, very rare
This book contains health and diet tips, and its
words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours
over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's
contents and practicing its guidelines, your
Constitution score increases by 2, as does your
maximum for that score. The manual then loses its
magic, but regains it in a century.
```
#### Manual of Gainful Exercise

```
Wondrous item, very rare
This book describes fitness exercises, and its words
are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a
period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's
contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength
score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that
score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it
in a century.
```
#### Manual of Golems

```
Wondrous item, very rare
This tome contains information and incantations
necessary to make a particular type of golem. The
GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To
decipher and use the manual, you must be a
spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A
creature that can't use a
 manual of golems and
attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.
d20 Golem Time
 Cost
1 - 5
 Clay 30 days 65,000 gp
6 - 17
 Flesh
 60 days 50,000 gp
18
 Iron 120 days 100,000 gp
19 - 20
 Stone 90 days 80,000 gp
```

To create a golem, you must spend the time shown
on the table, working without interruption with the
manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours
per day. You must also pay the specified cost to
purchase supplies.
Once you finish creating the golem, the book is
consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes
animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled
on it. It is under your control, and it understands and
obeys your spoken commands.

#### Manual of Quickness of Action

_Wondrous item, very rare_

This book contains coordination and balance
exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If
you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer
studying the book's contents and practicing its
guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as
does your maximum for that score. The manual then
loses its magic, but regains it in a century.

#### Marvelous Pigments

_Wondrous item, very rare_

Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box
with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these
pigments allow you to create three-dimensional
objects by painting them in two dimensions. The
paint flows from the brush to form the desired
object as you concentrate on its image.
 Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000
square feet of a surface, which lets you create
inanimate objects or terrain features--such as a
door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons--
that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes
to cover 100 square feet.
When you complete the painting, the object or
terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical
object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an
actual door that can be opened to whatever is
beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit,
and its depth counts against the total area of objects
you create.
Nothing created by the pigments can have a value
greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater
value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object
looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is
made from paste, bone, or some other worthless
material.
If you paint a form of energy such as fire or
lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon
as you complete the painting, doing no harm to
anything.

#### Medallion of Thoughts

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you
can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the
detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. The
medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn.
```
#### Mirror of Life Trapping

```
Wondrous item, very rare
When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its
surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror
weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points,
and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters
and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.
If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and
you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to
speak its command word and activate it. It remains
activated until you use an action to speak the
command word again.
Any creature other than you that sees its reflection
in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it
must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or
be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or
carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve
extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made
with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's
nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw
automatically.
An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse
filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet.
Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and
they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature
trapped within a cell can escape using magic that
permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is
confined to the cell until freed.
If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve
extradimensional cells are already occupied, the
mirror frees one trapped creature at random to
accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature
appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the
mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is
shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and
appear in unoccupied spaces near it.
While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an
action to speak the name of one creature trapped in
it or call out a particular cell by number. The
creature named or contained in the named cell
appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and
the creature can then communicate normally.
In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a
second command word and free one creature
```

trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears,
along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space
nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

#### Mithral Armor

_Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon_

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt
or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If
the armor normally imposes disadvantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength
requirement, the mithral version of the armor
doesn't.

#### Necklace of Adaptation

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe
normally in any environment, and you have
advantage on saving throws made against harmful
gases and vapors (such as
 _cloudkill_ and
 _stinking
cloud_ effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath
weapons of some dragons).

#### Necklace of Fireballs

_Wondrous item, rare_

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You
can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to
60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its
trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level
 _fireball_
spell (save DC 15).
You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole
necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the
level of the
 _fireball_ by 1 for each bead beyond the
first.

#### Necklace of Prayer Beads

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric,
druid, or paladin)_

This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from
aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many
nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber,
bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a
magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead
loses its magic.
Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the
type of each bead on the necklace or determines it
randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead
of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing
the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can
cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save
DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell

```
is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next
dawn.

#### Nine Lives Stealer

```
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a
critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100
hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears
its life force from its body (a construct or an undead
is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature
is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining,
it loses this property.
```
#### Oathbow

```
Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in
Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a
command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have
wronged me." The target of your attack becomes
your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven
days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy
at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can
choose a new one after the next dawn.
When you make a ranged attack roll with this
weapon against your sworn enemy, you have
advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains
no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and
you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the
attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6
piercing damage.
While your sworn enemy lives, you have
disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.
```
#### Oil of Etherealness

```
Potion, rare
Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of
its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can
cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the
equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional
```

vial is required for each size category above
Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The
affected creature then gains the effect of the
_etherealness_ spell for 1 hour.

#### Oil of Sharpness

_Potion, very rare_

This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin
silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or
piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or
piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1
minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and
has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

#### Oil of Slipperiness

_Potion, uncommon_

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the
container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil
can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with
the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one
additional vial is required for each size category
above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes.
The affected creature then gains the effect of a
_freedom of movement_ spell for 8 hours.
Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground
as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square,
duplicating the effect of the
 _grease_ spell in that area
for 8 hours.

#### Pearl of Power

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a
spellcaster)_

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an
action to speak its command word and regain one
expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th
level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you
use the pearl, it can't be used again until the next
dawn.

#### Periapt of Health

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

You are immune to contracting any disease while
you wear this pendant. If you are already infected
with a disease, the effects of the disease are
suppressed you while you wear the pendant.

#### Periapt of Proof against Poison

_Wondrous item, rare_

This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black
gem pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no

```
effect on you. You are immune to the poisoned
condition and have immunity to poison damage.
```
#### Periapt of Wound Closure

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever
you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition,
whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points,
double the number of hit points it restores.
```
#### Philter of Love

```
Potion, uncommon
The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes
after drinking this philter, you become charmed by
that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species
and gender you are normally attracted to, you
regard it as your true love while you are charmed.
This potion's rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains
one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
```
#### Pipes of Haunting

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
You must be proficient with wind instruments to use
these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an
action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an
eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet
of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15
Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you
for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area
that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed
on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving
throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature
that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the
effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain
1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
```
#### Pipes of the Sewers

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
You must be proficient with wind instruments to use
these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes,
ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward
you and will not attack you unless you threaten or
harm them.
The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as
an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to
3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each
expended charge, provided that enough rats are
within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion
(as determined by the GM). If there aren't enough
rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called
```

swarms move toward the music by the shortest
available route but aren't under your control
otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges
daily at dawn.
Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another
creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while
you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma
check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If
you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it
normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes'
music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest,
the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and
becomes friendly to you and your companions for as
long as you continue to play the pipes each round as
an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If
you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it
defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a
friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the
pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and
the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be
swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

#### Plate Armor of Etherealness

_Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)_

While you're wearing this armor, you can speak its
command word as an action to gain the effect of the
_etherealness_ spell, which last for 10 minutes or until
you remove the armor or use an action to speak the
command word again. This property of the armor
can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Portable Hole

_Wondrous item, rare_

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a
circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
You can use an action to unfold a
 _portable hole_ and
place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the
_portable hole_ creates an extradimensional hole 10
feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole
exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to
create open passages. Any creature inside an open
_portable hole_ can exit the hole by climbing out of it.
You can use an action to close a
 _portable hole_ by
taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.
Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures
or objects within remain in the extradimensional
space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to
nothing.
If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's
extradimensional space can use an action to make a
DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the

```
creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet
of the
 portable hole or the creature carrying it. A
breathing creature within a closed
 portable hole can
survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it
begins to suffocate.
Placing a
 portable hole inside an extradimensional
space created by a
 bag of holding ,
 handy haversack ,
or similar item instantly destroys both items and
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through
it and deposited in a random location on the Astral
Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only
and can't be reopened.

mix the colors.

```

When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce"
effect of the

the bottle fails to interrupt this process.

on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than

sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate
type. The

dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink
floating in it.
```
#### Potion of Poison

```
Potion, uncommon
This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a
 potion
of healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is
actually poison masked by illusion magic. An
 identify
spell reveals its true nature.
If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and
you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your
turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take
3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns,

#### Ring of Djinni Summoning

```

While wearing this ring, you can speak its command
word as an action to summon a particular djinni
from the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni appears
in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet

concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or
until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its
home plane.
While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and
your companions. It obeys any commands you give it,
no matter what language you use. If you fail to

While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you
can cast
 _dancing lights_ and
 _light_ from the ring at will.
Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.

to cast
 _faerie fire_ from the ring.
**_Ball Lightning._** You can expend 2 charges as an
action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres

long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a
spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in
a 30-foot radius.

```

30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you.
When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet

```
#### Ring of Spell Storing

This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until

GM.
Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th
level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is
cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored
in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is
expended without effect. The level of the slot used to
cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell
stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save
DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the
original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast
the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer
stored in it, freeing up space.
```

The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes
its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each
charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force
damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.
Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's
charges as an action to try to break an object you can

 _daylight_ spell
cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be
blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your

stunned until the effect ends.

it to cast
 _magic missile_ as a 5th-level spell. Daily at
dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.
While you wear the robe, you can use an action to
enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are
wearing and carrying. You remain there until you
use an action to return to the plane you were on. You
reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that
space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.

#### Robe of the Archmagi

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_

This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of
white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes.
The robe's color corresponds to the alignment for
which the item was created. A white robe was made
for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You
can't attune to a
 _robe of the archmagi_ that doesn't
correspond to your alignment.
You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:

- If you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor
 Class is 15 + your Dexterity modifier.
- You have advantage on saving throws against
 spells and other magical effects.
- Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each
 increase by 2.

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and

- Dagger
- Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)
- Steel mirror
- 10- foot pole
- Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled)

#### Rod of Absorption

```
Rod, very rare (requires attunement)
While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to
absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with
an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is
canceled, and the spell's energy--not the spell
itself--is stored in the rod. The energy has the same
level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can
absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the
course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50
levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are
targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod
has no effect on that spell.
When you become attuned to the rod, you know
how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed
over the course of its existence, and how many levels
of spell energy it currently has stored.
If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can
convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast
spells you have prepared or know. You can create
spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your
own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You
use the stored levels in place of your slots, but
otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you
can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell
slot.
```

A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy
stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb
spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes
nonmagical.

#### Rod of Alertness

_Rod, very rare (requires attunement)_

This rod has a flanged head and the following
properties.
**_Alertness._** While holding the rod, you have
advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on
rolls for initiative.
**_Spells.
_** While holding the rod, you can use an
action to cast one of the following spells from it:
_detect evil and good_ ,
 _detect magic_ ,
 _detect poison and
disease_ , or
 _see invisibility._
**_Protective Aura._** As an action, you can plant the
haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the
rod's head sheds bright light in a 60-foo t radius and
dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that
bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to
you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can
sense the location of any invisible hostile creature
that is also in the bright light.
The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends
after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action
to pull the rod from the ground. This property can't
be used again until the next dawn.

#### Rod of Lordly Might

_Rod, legendary (requires attunement)_

This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a
magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and
damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties
associated with six different buttons that are set in a
row along the haft. It has three other properties as
well, detailed below.
**_Six Buttons._** You can press one of the rod's six
buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts
until you push a different button or until you push
the same button again, which causes the rod to
revert to its normal form.
If you press **button 1** , the rod becomes a
 _flame
tongue_ , as a fiery blade sprouts from the end
opposite the rod's flanged head.
If you press
 **button 2** , the rod's flanged head folds
down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out,
transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that
grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
with it.
If you press
 **button 3** , the rod's flanged head folds
down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and

```
the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft,
transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a
+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
If you press
 button 4 , the rod transforms into a
climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In
surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and
three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal
bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot
apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to
4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid
anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal
form.
If you press
 button 5 , the rod transforms into a
handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10
bonus to Strength checks made to break through
doors, barricades, and other barriers.
If you press
 button 6 , the rod assumes or remains
in its normal form and indicates magnetic north.
(Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used
in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod
also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth
beneath the ground or your height above it.
Drain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee
attack using the rod, you can force the target to
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure,
the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and
you regain a number of hit points equal to half that
necrotic damage. This property can't be used again
until the next dawn.
Paralyze. When you hit a creature with a melee
attack using the rod, you can force the target to
make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure,
the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on a success. This property
can't be used again until the next dawn.
Terrify. While holding the rod, you can use an
action to force each creature you can see within 30
feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw.
On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1
minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. This property can't be
used again until the next dawn.
```
#### Rod of Rulership

```
Rod, rare (requires attunement)
You can use an action to present the rod and
command obedience from each creature of your
choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each
target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While
charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its
```

trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions,
or commanded to do something contrary to its
nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way.
The rod can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Rod of Security

_Rod, very rare_

While holding this rod, you can use an action to
activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and
up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a
paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You
choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a
tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern,
immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or
whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its
nature, the paradise contains enough water and food
to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be
interacted with inside the extraplanar space can
exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a
garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken
outside the extraplanar space.
For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor
regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also,
creatures don't age while in the paradise, although
time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the
paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number
of creatures present (round down).
When the time runs out or you use an action to
end it, all visitors reappear in the location they
occupied when you activated the rod, or an
unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod
can't be used again until ten days have passed.

#### Rope of Climbing

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and
can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of
the rope and use an action to speak the command
word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can
command the other end to move toward a
destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on
your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on
each of your turns until reaching its destination, up
to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to
stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself
securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or
unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.
If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-
foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope
shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on
checks made to climb it.

```
The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1
hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1
hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is
destroyed.
```
#### Rope of Entanglement

```
Wondrous item, rare
This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you
hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak
its command word, the other end darts forward to
entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you.
The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw or become restrained.
You can release the creature by using a bonus
action to speak a second command word. A target
restrained by the rope can use an action to make a
DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice).
On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by
the rope.
The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1
hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1
hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is
destroyed.
```
#### Scarab of Protection

```
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
If you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your
hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its
surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two
benefits while it is on your person:
```
- You have advantage on saving throws against
 spells.
- The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving
 throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful
 effect originating from an undead creature, you
 can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn
 the failed save into a successful one. The scarab
 crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its
 last charge is expended.

#### Scimitar of Speed

```
Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can
make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of
your turns.
```

#### Shield, +1, +2, or +3

_Armor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very
rare
 (+3)_

While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC
determined by the shield's rarity. This bonus is in
addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

#### Shield of Missile Attraction

_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

While holding this shield, you have resistance to
damage from ranged weapon attacks.
**_Curse._** This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses
you until you are targeted by the
 _remove curse_ spell
or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the
curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is
made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse
causes you to become the target instead.

#### Slippers of Spider Climbing

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up,
down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down
along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You
have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
However, the slippers don't allow you to move this
way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice
or oil.

#### Sovereign Glue

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a
permanent adhesive bond between any two objects.
It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been
coated inside with
 _oil of slipperiness._ When found, a
container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.
One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square
surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has
done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by
the application of
 _universal solvent_ or
 _oil of
etherealness_ , or with a
 _wish_ spell.

#### Spell Scroll

_Scroll, varies_

A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell,
written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your
class's spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its
spell without providing any material components.
Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the
spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal
casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the

```
scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is
interrupted, the scroll is not lost.
If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a
higher level than you can normally cast, you must
make an ability check using your spellcasting ability
to determine whether you cast it successfully. The
DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the
spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the
spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as
the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.
```

```
A wizard spell on a
 spell scroll can be copied just as
spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is
copied from a
 spell scroll , the copier must succeed on
an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10
+ the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is
successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or
fails, the
 spell scroll is destroyed.
```
#### Spellguard Shield

```
Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)
While holding this shield, you have advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical
effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against
you.
```
#### Sphere of Annihilation

```
Wondrous item, legendary
This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the
multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a
magical field surrounding it.
The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through
and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are
the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to
damage from a
 sphere of annihilation , it passes
through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that
touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and
obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.
```

The sphere is stationary until someone controls it.
If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere,
you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence
(Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in
one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet
equal to 5 [x] your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5
feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward
you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must
succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be
touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.
If you attempt to control a sphere that is under
another creature's control, you make an Intelligence
(Arcana) check contested by the other creature's
Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the
contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it
as normal.
If the sphere comes into contact with a planar
portal, such as that created by the
 _gate_ spell, or an
extradimensional space, such as that within a
_portable hole_ , the GM determines randomly what
hap pens, using the following table.

**d100
 Result**
01- 50
 The sphere is destroyed.
51 - 85
 The sphere moves through the portal or into
the extradimensional space.
86 - 00
 A spatial rift sends each creature and object
within 180 feet of the sphere, including the
sphere, to a random plane of existence.

#### Staff of Charming

_Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric,
druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_

While holding this staff, you can use an action to
expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast
 _charm person_ ,
_command_ ,
 _or comprehend languages_ from it using

magic quarterstaff.
If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw
against an enchantment spell that targets only you,
you can turn your failed save into a successful one.
You can't use this property of the staff again until the
next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an
enchantment spell that targets only you, with or
without the staff's intervention, you can use your
reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn
the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an
explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere
centered on it.
You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to
a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion.
If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage

the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its

absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings
the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff
explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see
below).

#### Staff of the Python

_Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric,
druid, or warlock)_

You can use an action to speak this staff's command
word and throw the staff on the ground within 10
feet of you. The staff becomes a giant constrictor
snake under your control and acts on its own
initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the
command word again, you return the staff to its
normal form in a space formerly occupied by the
snake.
On your turn, you can mentally command the
snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't
incapacitated. You decide what action the snake
takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you
can issue it a general command, such as to attack
your enemies or guard a location.
If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and
reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is
destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before
losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.

branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.
The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura
of transmutation magic if targeted by
 detect magic .

speak its command word, you return the staff to its
normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it
reverts to a staff.
```
#### Staff of Thunder and Lightning

```
Staff, very rare (requires attunement)
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that
grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made

properties. When one of these properties is used, it
can't be used again until the next dawn.
Lightning. When you hit with a melee attack using
the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra

bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a line
that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in
that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw,
```

taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one.
**_Thunderclap._** You can use an action to cause the
staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to
600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not
including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6
thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute.
On a successful save, a creature takes half damage
and isn't deafened.
**_Thunder and Lightning._** You can use an action to
use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties
at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily
use of those properties, only the use of this one.

#### Staff of Withering

_Staff, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or
warlock)_

This staff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended
charges daily at dawn.

elemental_ spell. The stone can't be used this way
again until the next dawn. The stone weighs 5
pounds.

#### Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone)

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While this polished agate is on your person, you gain

#### Sun Blade

_Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)_

This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While
grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause
a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence, or
make the blade disappear. While the blade exists,
this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you
are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you
are proficient with the
 _sun blade_ .

```
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage
instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead
with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant
damage.
The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a
15 -foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.
The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you
can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of
bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of

the target.
When you attack a creature with this weapon and
roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra
4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you
roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with
the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the
creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an
attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the
target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's
turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time
you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all
such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the
wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it,
```

can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom
(Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds
on it on a success.

#### Talisman of Pure Good

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a

This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A
creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment
takes 6d6 radiant damage upon touching the
talisman. An evil creature takes 8d6 radiant damage
upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature
takes the damage again each time it ends its turn
holding or carrying the talisman.
If you are a good cleric or paladin, you can use the
talisman as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus
to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.
The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or
holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge
from it and choose one creature you can see on the
ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil
alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The
target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving
throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed,
leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving
no trace of its existence. When you expend the last
charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden
light and is destroyed.

of additional feet equal to 10 [x] your Intelligence
modifier.

#### Talisman of Ultimate Evil

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a
creature of evil alignment)_

creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching
the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the
damage again each time it ends its turn holding or

holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge
from the talisman and choose one creature you can
see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the
target is of good alignment, a flaming fissure opens
under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20
Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be
destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then
closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you
expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into
foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.

head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to
slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has
legendary actions, or the GM decides that the

slashing damage from the hit.

 well
of many worlds on a solid surface, whereupon it
creates a two-way portal to another world or plane
of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the
GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to

```
#### Wind Fan

every 12 hours they aren't in use.

#### Wings of Flying

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to
speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a
pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1
hour or until you repeat the command word as an
action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet.
When they disappear, you can't use them again for
1d12 hours.

## Sentient Magic Items

Some magic items possess sentience and personality.
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the
spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to
the magic used to create it. In any case, the item
behaves like a character, complete with personality
quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A
sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder
or a continual thorn in the side.
Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of
items can manifest sentience, but consumable items
such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.
Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the
GM's control. Any activated property of the item is
under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as
the wielder maintains a good relationship with the
item, the wielder can access those properties
normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can
suppress its activated properties or even turn them
against the wielder.

### Creating Sentient Magic Items

When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you
create the item's persona in the same way you would
create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.

#### Abilities

```
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores. You can choose the item's abilities
or determine them randomly. To determine them
randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest
roll and totaling the rest.
```
#### Communication

```
A sentient item has some ability to communicate,
either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its
thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can
choose how it communicates or roll on the following
table.
d100 Communication
01- 60
 The item communicates by transmitting emotion
to the creature carrying or wielding it.
61- 90
 The item can speak, read, and understand one
or more languages.
91- 00
 The item can speak, read, and understand one
or more languages. In addition, the item can
communicate telepathically with any character
that carries or wields it.
```
#### Senses

```
With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item
can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range.
You can choose its senses or roll on the following
table.
d4 Senses
1
 Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.
2
 Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet
3
 Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet.
4
 Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.
```
#### Alignment

```
A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator
or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can
pick an alignment or roll on the following table.
d100 Alignment d100 Alignment
01 - 15
 Lawful good 74 - 85
 Chaotic neutral
16 - 35
 Neutral good 86 - 89
 Lawful evil
36 - 50
 Chaotic good
 90 - 96
 Neutral evil
51 - 63
 Lawful neutral 97 - 00
 Chaotic evil
64 - 73
 Neutral
```
#### Special Purpose

```
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues,
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the
wielder's use of the item aligns with that special
purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating
from this course might cause conflict between the
wielder and the item, and could even cause the item
to prevent the use of its activated properties. You
```

can pick a special purpose or roll on the following
table.

**d10
 Purpose**
1
 _Aligned:_ The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a
diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is
never neutral.)
2
 _Bane:_ The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of
a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls,
or wizards.
3
 _Protector:_ The item seeks to defend a particular race
or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.
4
 _Crusader:_ The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or
destroy the servants of a particular deity.
5
 Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and
interests of a particular deity.
6
 _Destroyer:_ The item craves destruction and goads its
user to fight arbitrarily.
7
 _Glory Seeker:_ The item seeks renown as the greatest
magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a
famous or notorious figure.
8
 _Lore
 Seeker:_ The item craves knowledge or is
determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or
unravel a cryptic prophecy.
9
 _Destiny Seeker:_ The item is convinced that it and its
wielder have key roles to play in future events.
10
 _Creator Seeker:_ The item seeks its creator and wants
to understand why it was created.

### Conflict

A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its
personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a
manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose,
conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the
item makes a Charisma check contested by the
wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the
contest, it makes one or more of the following
demands:

- The item insists on being carried or worn at all
 times.
- The item demands that its wielder dispose of
 anything the item finds repugnant.
- The item demands that its wielder pursue the
 item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.
- The item demands to be given to someone else.

If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's
wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:

- Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.
- Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
- Attempt to take control of its wielder.

If a sentient item attempts to take control of its
wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving

```
throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma
modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by
the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder
must try to follow the item's commands. If the
wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw,
ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt
to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can't
use this power again until the next dawn.
```
## Artifacts

#### Orb of Dragonkind

```
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)
Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war
against evil dragons. When the world seemed
doomed, powerful wizards came together and
worked their greatest magic, forging five
 Orbs of
Dragonkind (or
 Dragon Orbs ) to help them defeat the
dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five
wizard towers, and there they were used to speed
the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used
the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the
dragons with powerful magic.
As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs
were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three
are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped
and twisted over the centuries, so although their
primary purpose of calling dragons still functions,
they also allow some measure of control over
dragons.
Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a
presence that resents any attempt to coax magic
from it. Those lacking in force of personality might
find themselves enslaved to an orb.
An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches
in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches
in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to
peer into the orb's depths and speak its command
word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check.
On a successful check, you control the orb for as long
as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you
become charmed by the orb for as long as you
remain attuned to it.
While you are charmed by the orb, you can't
voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb
casts
 suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging
you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The
dragon essence within the orb might want many
things: the annihilation of a particular people,
freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the
```

world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or
something else the GM decides.
**_Random Properties._** An
 _Orb of Dragonkind_ has the
following random properties:

- 2 minor beneficial properties
- 1 minor detrimental property
- 1 major detrimental property

**_Spells._** The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3
expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the
orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more
charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC
18) from it:
 _cure wounds_ (5th -level version, 3
charges), _daylight_ (1 charge),
 _death ward_ (2 charges),
or
 _scrying_ (3 charges).
You can also use an action to cast the
 _detect magic
_
spell from the orb without using any charges.
**_Call Dragons._** While you control the orb, you can
use an action to cause the artifact to issue a
telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40
miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come
to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct
route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected
by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be
hostile toward you for compelling them against their
will. Once you have used this property, it can't be
used again for 1 hour.
**_Destroying an Orb._** An
 _Orb of Dragonkind_ appears
fragile but is impervious to most damage, including
the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A
_disintegrate_ spell or one good hit from a +3 magic
weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.


# Monsters

A monster's statistics, sometimes referred to as its
**stat block** , provide the essential information that
you need to run the monster.

### Size

A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge,
or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how
much space a creature of a particular size controls in
combat. See the
 _Player's Handbook_ for more
info rmation on creature size and space.

#### Size Categories

**Size Space Examples**
Tiny 2[-1/2] by 2[-1/2] ft. Imp, sprite
Small 5 by 5 ft. Giant rat, goblin
Medium 5 by 5 ft. Orc, werewolf
Large 10 by 10 ft. Hippogriff, ogre
Huge 15 by 15 ft. Fire giant, treant
Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger Kraken, purple worm

##### Modifying Creatures

Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you
might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect
creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an
existing creature to make it into something more useful for
you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different
monster or by using a
 **variant** or
 **template** , such as the ones
in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster,
including when you apply a template to it, might change its
challenge rating.

### Type

A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature.
Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other
effects in the game interact in special ways with
creatures of a particular type. For example, an
 _arrow
of dragon slaying_ deals extra damage not only to
dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type,
such as dragon turtles and wyverns.
The game includes the following monster types,
which have no rules of their own.
**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of
them have innate magical abilities drawn from the
creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces
of the world. The quintessential aberrations are
aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.
**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a
natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them

```
have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and
lack any society or language. Beasts include all
varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant
versions of animals.
Celestials are creatures native to the Upper
Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities,
employed as messengers or agents in the mortal
realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good
by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays
from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity.
Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.
Constructs are made, not born. Some are
programmed by their creators to follow a simple set
of instructions, while others are imbued with
sentience and capable of independent thought.
Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures
native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as
modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw
material of the plane by the will of more powerful
creatures.
Dragons are large reptilian creatures of ancient
origin and tremendous power. True dragons,
including the good metallic dragons and the evil
chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have
innate magic. Also in this category are creatures
distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful,
less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns
and pseudodragons.
Elementals
 are creatures native to the elemental
planes. Some creatures of this type are little more
than animate masses of their respective elements,
including the creatures simply called elementals.
Others have biological forms infused with elemental
energy. The races of genies, including djinn and
efreet, form the most important civilizations on the
elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include
azers and invisible stalkers.
Fey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces
of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty
forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the
Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are
also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the
planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include
dryads, pixies, and satyrs.
Fiends are creatures of wickedness that are native
to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities,
but many more labor under the leadership of
archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and
mages sometimes summon fiends to the material
world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a
rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends
include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and
yugoloths.
```

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They
are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple
heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six
varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants,
frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm
giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and
trolls are giants.
**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy
gaming world, both civilized and savage, including
humans and a tremendous variety of other species.
They have language and culture, few if any innate
magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn
spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common
humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player
characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings.
Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal,
and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids
(goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls,
lizardfolk, and kobolds.
**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest
sense--frightening creatures that are not ordinary,
not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are
the results of magical experimentation gone awry
(such as owlbears), and others are the product of
terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti).
They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as
a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into
any other type.
**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a
fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling
in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion,
or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way.
Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the
most recognizable oozes.
**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not
ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and
some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are
the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal
creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also
fall into this category.
**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a
horrifying state of undeath through the practice of
necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead
include walking corpses, such as vampires and
zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts
and specters.

#### Tags

A monster might have one or more tags appended to
its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the
_humanoid (orc)_ type. The parenthetical tags provide
additional categorization for certain creatures. The
tags have no rules of their own, but something in the

```
game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For
instance, a spear that is especially effective at
fighting demons would work against any monster
that has the demon tag.
```
### Alignment

```
A monster's alignment provides a clue to its
disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or
combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil
monster might be difficult to reason with and might
attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral
monster might be willing to negotiate. See the
Player's Handbook for descriptions of the different
alignments.
The alignment specified in a monster's stat block
is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change
a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your
campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon
or an evil storm giant, there's nothing stopping you.
Some creatures can have
 any alignment . In other
words, you choose the monster's alignment. Some
monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or
aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For
example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment
(chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as
befits its wild nature.
Many creatures of low intelligence have no
comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They
don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act
on instinct. These creatures are
 unaligned , which
means they don't have an alignment.
```
### Armor Class

```
A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has
an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and
Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is
based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if
any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or
carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its
AC value.
```
### Hit Points

```
A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops
to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the
Player's Handbook.
A monster's hit points are presented both as a die
expression and as an average number. For example,
a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on
average (2 [x] 4[-1/2]).
A monster's size determines the die used to
calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by
Size table.
```

#### Hit Dice by Size

**Monster Size Hit Die Average HP per Die**
Tiny d4 2[-1/2]
Small d6 3[-1/2]
Medium d8 4[-1/2]
Large d10 5[-1/2]
Huge d12 6[-1/2]
Gargantuan d20 10[-1/2]

A monster's Constitution modifier also affects the
number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier
is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses,
and the result is added to its hit points. For example,
if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier)
and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average
11).

### Speed

A monster's speed tells you how far it can move on
its turn. For more information on speed, see the
_Player's Handbook._
All creatures have a walking speed, simply called
the monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of
ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0
feet.
Some creatures have one or more of the following
additional movement modes.

#### Burrow

A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that
speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A
monster can't burrow through solid rock unless it
has a special trait that allows it to do so.

#### Climb

A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or
part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces.
The monster doesn't need to spend extra movement
to climb.

#### Fly

A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part
of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the
ability to
 **hover** , which makes them hard to knock
out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in
the
 _Player's Handbook_ ). Such a monster stops
hovering when it dies.

#### Swim

A monster that has a swimming speed doesn't need
to spend extra movement to swim.

### Ability Scores

```
Every monster has six ability scores (Strength,
Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more
information on ability scores and how they're used
in play, see the
 Player's Handbook.
```
### Saving Throws

```
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures
that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects.
For example, a creature that isn't easily charmed or
frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving
throws. Most creatures don't have special saving
throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.
A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster's
relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus,
which is determined by the monster's challenge
rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by
Challenge Rating table).
```
#### Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating

### Skills

```
The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are
proficient in one or more skills. For example, a
monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might
have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity
(Stealth) checks.
A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant
ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is
determined by the monster's challenge rating (as
shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating
table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a
```

monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus
(usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for
its heightened expertise.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and

### Immunities

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or
immunity to certain types of damage. Particular
creatures are even resistant or immune to damage
from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an
attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another
magical source). In addition, some creatures are
immune to certain conditions.

### Senses

The Senses entry notes a monster's passive Wisdom
(Perception) score, as well as any special senses the
monster might have. Special senses are described
below.

#### Blindsight

A monster with blindsight can perceive its
surroundings without relying on sight, within a
specific radius.
Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and
gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do
creatures with echolocation or heightened senses,
such as bats and true dragons.
If a monster is naturally blind, it has a
parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the
radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range
of its perception.

#### Darkvision

A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within
a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light
within the radius as if it were bright light, and in
darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many
creatures that live underground have this special
sense.

##### Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies

Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons,
and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the
creature is proficient with its new equipment.
For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and
wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain
mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is
proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.
See the
 _Player's Handbook_ for rules on using armor or
weapons without proficiency.

#### Tremorsense

```
A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint
the origin of vibrations within a specific radius,
provided that the monster and the source of the
vibrations are in contact with the same ground or
substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect
flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing
creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have
this special sense.
```
#### Truesight

```
A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range,
see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible
creatures and objects, automatically detect visual
illusions and succeed on saving throws against them,
and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or
a creature that is transformed by magic.
Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal
Plane within the same range.
```
### Languages

```
The languages that a monster can speak are listed in
alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can
understand a language but can't speak it, and this is
noted in its entry. A "--" indicates that a creature
neither speaks nor understands any language.
```
#### Telepathy

```
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster
to communicate mentally with another creature
within a specified range. The contacted creature
doesn't need to share a language with the monster to
communicate in this way with it, but it must be able
to understand at least one language. A creature
without telepathy can receive and respond to
telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a
telepathic conversation.
A telepathic monster doesn't need to see a
contacted creature and can end the telepathic
contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as
the two creatures are no longer within range of each
other or if the telepathic monster contacts a
different creature within range. A telepathic monster
can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation
without using an action, but while the monster is
incapacitated, it can't initiate telepathic contact, and
any current contact is terminated.
A creature within the area of an
 antimagic field or
in any other location where magic doesn't function
can't send or receive telepathic messages.
```

### Challenge

A monster's
 **challenge rating** tells you how great a
threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped
and well-rested party of four adventurers should be
able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating
equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For
example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should
find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a
worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.
Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-
level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1.
Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are
insignificant except in large numbers; those with no
effective attacks are worth no experience points,
while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.
Some monsters present a greater challenge than
even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These
monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and
are specifically designed to test player skill.

#### Experience Points

The number of experience points (XP) a monster is
worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP
is awarded for defeating the monster, although the
GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat
posed by the monster in some other manner.
Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster
summoned by a spell or other magical ability is
worth the XP noted in its stat block.

### Special Traits

```
Special traits (which appear after a monster's
challenge rating but before any actions or reactions)
are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a
combat encounter and that require some
explanation.
```
#### Innate Spellcasting

```
A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has
the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted
otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is
always cast at its lowest possible level and can't be
cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip
where its level matters and no level is given, use the
monster's challenge rating.
An innate spell can have special rules or
restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately
cast the
 levitate spell, but the spell has a "self only"
restriction, which means that the spell affects only
the drow mage.
A monster's innate spells can't be swapped out
with other spells. If a monster's innate spells don't
require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for
them.
```
#### Spellcasting

```
A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a
spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast
its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the
Player's Handbook ). The spellcaster level is also used
for any cantrips included in the feature.
The monster has a list of spells known or prepared
from a specific class. The list might also include
spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine
Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle
feature of the druid. The monster is considered a
member of that class when attuning to or using a
magic item that requires membership in the class or
access to its spell list.
A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher
level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a
drow mage with the 3rd-level
 lightning bolt spell can
cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level
spell slots.
You can change the spells that a monster knows or
has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with
a spell of the same level and from the same class list.
If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a
greater or lesser threat than suggested by its
challenge rating.
```

#### Psionics

A monster that casts spells using only the power of
its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting
or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries
no special rules of its own, but other parts of the
game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag
typically doesn't require any components to cast its
spells.

### Actions

When a monster takes its action, it can choose from
the options in the Actions section of its stat block or
use one of the actions available to all creatures, such
as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the
_Player's Handbook_ .

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks

The most common actions that a monster will take
in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can
be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the
"weapon" might be a manufactured item or a natural
weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more
information on different kinds of attacks, see the
_Player's Handbook_.
**_Creature vs. Target._** The target of a melee or
ranged attack is usually either one creature or one
target, the difference being that a "target" can be a
creature or an object.
**_Hit._** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur
as a result of an attack hitting a target are described
after the " _Hit_ " notation. You have the option of
taking average damage or rolling the damage; for
this reason, both the average damage and the die
expression are presented.
**_Miss._** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a
miss, that information is presented after the " _Miss:_ "
notation.

#### Multiattack

A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn
has the Multiattack action. A creature can't use
Multiattack when making an opportunity attack,
which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition

A monster carries enough ammunition to make its
ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has
2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon
attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a
projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.

### Reactions

```
If a monster can do something special with its
reaction, that information is contained here. If a
creature has no special reaction, this section is
absent.
```
### Limited Usage

```
Some special abilities have restrictions on the
number of times they can be used.
X/Day. The notation "X/Day" means a special
ability can be used X number of times and that a
monster must finish a long rest to regain expended
uses. For example, "1/Day" means a special ability
can be used once and that the monster must finish a
long rest to use it again.
Recharge X-Y. The notation "Recharge X-Y"
means a monster can use a special ability once and
that the ability then has a random chance of
recharging during each subsequent round of combat.
At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6.
If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge
notation, the monster regains the use of the special
ability. The ability also recharges when the monster
finishes a short or long rest.
For example, "Recharge 5-6" means a monster can
use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the
monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it
rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.
Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This
notation means that a monster can use a special
ability once and then must finish a short or long rest
to use it again.
```
##### Grapple Rules for Monsters

```
Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to
quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an
attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to
determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack
says otherwise.
A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to
try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape
DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given,
assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (Athletics)
modifier.
```
### Equipment

```
A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than
armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature
that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid,
is assumed to be dressed appropriately.
```

You can equip monsters with additional gear and
trinkets however you like, and you decide how much
of a monster's equipment is recoverable after the
creature is slain and whether any of that equipment
is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a
monster is rarely usable by someone else, for
instance.
If a spellcasting monster needs material
components to cast its spells, assume that it has the
material components it needs to cast the spells in its
stat block.

## Legendary Creatures

A legendary creature can do things that ordinary
creatures can't. It can take special actions outside its
turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles
around.
If a creature assumes the form of a legendary
creature, such as through a spell, it doesn't gain that
form's legendary actions, lair actions, or regional
effects.

### Legendary Actions

A legendary creature can take a certain number of
special actions--called legendary actions--outside
its turn. Only one legendary action option can be
used at a time and only at the end of another
creature's turn. A creature regains its spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo
using them, and it can't use them while incapacitated
or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it
can't use them until after its first turn in the combat.

### A Legendary Creature's Lair

A legendary creature might have a section
describing its lair and the special effects it can create
while there, either by act of will or simply by being
present. Such a section applies only to a legendary
creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.

#### Lair Actions

If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use
them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On
initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can
use one of its lair action options. It can't do so while
incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If
surprised, it can't use one until after its first turn in
the combat.

#### Regional Effects

The mere presence of a legendary creature can have
strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as

```
noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly
or dissipate over time when the legendary creature
dies.
```

## Monsters (A)

#### Aboleth

_Large aberration, lawful evil

**_Amphibious._** The aboleth can breathe air and water.

**_Mucous Cloud._** While underwater, the aboleth is
surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that
touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack
while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14
Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is
diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can
breathe only underwater.

**_Probing Telepathy._** If a creature communicates
telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the
creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the
creature.

##### Actions

**_Multiattack._** The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.

**_Tentacle.
_** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target.
 _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If
the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The
disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed

Petrifying Gaze. If a creature starts its turn within 30

A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to
avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does
so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn,
when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the

_Large aberration, chaotic neutral_

```
**Skills** Stealth +5

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11

**Languages** Deep Speech, Undercommon

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)

**_Damage Transfer._** While attached to a creature, the
cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded
down), and that creature takes the other half.

**_False Appearance._** While the cloaker remains
motionless without its underside exposed, it is
indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.

**_Light Sensitivity.
_** While in bright light, the cloaker has
disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight.

##### Actions

```
Multiattack. The cloaker makes two attacks: one with
its bite and one with its tail.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
 Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the
target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If
the cloaker has advantage against the target, the
cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is
blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is
attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this
attack only against the target and has advantage on the
attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5
feet of its movement. A creature, including the target,
can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding
on a DC 16 Strength check.
Tail.
 Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
creature.
 Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.
Moan. Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that
can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must
succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a
creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is
immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours
Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The
cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of
itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with
it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make
it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If
the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the
duplicates disappear.
Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an
attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains,
that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it
targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature
is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it
relies on senses other than sight.
A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving
throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate
fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage,
the duplicate disappears.

```
##### Actions

```
Bite.
 Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
 Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the
target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until this poison
ends, the target is unconscious. Another creature can
use an action to shake the target awake.
Constrict.
 Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one Medium or smaller creature.
 Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3)
bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled
(escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is
restrained, and the couatl can't constrict another
target.
Change Shape.
 The couatl magically polymorphs into a
humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to
or less than its own, or back into its true form. It
reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new
form (the couatl's choice).
In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics
and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes,
Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by
those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and
capabilities (except class features, legendary actions,
and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.
If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its
bite in that form.

**Challenge** 1/2 (100 XP)

**_Echolocation._** The darkmantle can't use its blindsight
while deafened.

**_False Appearance._** While the darkmantle remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from a cave
formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite.

##### Actions

**_Crush.
_** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
 _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the
darkmantle attaches to the target. If the target is
Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage
on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target's
head, and the target is also blinded and unable to
breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way.
While attached to the target, the darkmantle can
attack no other creature except the target but has
advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle's speed
also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its
speed, and it moves with the target.
A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a
successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its
turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target
by using 5 feet of movement.

**_Darkness Aura (1/Day)._** A 15-foot radius of magical
darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with
it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as
long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to
10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision
can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can
illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an
area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower,
the spell creating the light is dispelled.

each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20
Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The explosion ignites flammable
objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried,
and it destroys the balor's weapons.
Fire Aura. At the start of each of the balor's turns, each
creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage,
and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being
worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the
balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet

Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain
to make one additional chain attack. An animated

reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points
or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.

**_Wall of Ice (Recharge 6)._** The devil magically forms an
opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within
60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet
long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up
to 20 feet in diameter.
When the wall appears, each creature in its space is
pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature
chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the
creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a
DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

```
successful one.
The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is
incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and
breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points,
vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold,
necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is
destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the
space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes
moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or
otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17
Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest
of the wall vanishes.

feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC
13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 [x]
10
 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for
the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed

```
with a
 greater restoration spell, but only within 24
hours of it occurring.
Possession (Recharge 6). One humanoid that the ghost
can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13
Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost;
the ghost then disappears, and the target is
incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost
now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target
of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any
attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn
undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed
and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed
target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the
target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit
points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost
is turned or forced out by an effect like the
 dispel evil
and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost
reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession
for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or
after the possession ends.

berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem
attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is

golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and
persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its

##### Actions

```
Claws.
 Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
 Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
Illusory Appearance.
 The hag covers herself and
anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical
illusion that makes her look like another creature of
her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends
if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear
to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would
feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take
an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on
a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern
that the hag is disguised.
Invisible Passage. The hag magically turns invisible
until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her
concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her
passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any
equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

**_Change Shape._** The hag magically polymorphs into a
Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her
true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any
equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
She reverts to her true form if she dies.

**_Etherealness._** The hag magically enters the Ethereal
Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so,
the hag must have a
 _heartstone
_ in her possession.

**_Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)._** While on the Ethereal
Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid
on the Material Plane. A
 _protection from evil and good_
spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a
_magic circle_ . As long as the contact persists, the target
has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1
hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its
hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect
reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target
dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the
hag's
 _soul bag_ . The reduction to the target's hit point
maximum lasts until removed by the
 _greater
restoration_ spell or similar magic.

a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect
ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific
Appearance for the next 24 hours.
Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the

the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving
throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.
Illusory Appearance.
 The hag covers herself and
anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical
illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her
general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if
the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear
to have no claws, but someone touching her hand
might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take
an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on

Luring Song.
 The harpy sings a magical melody. Every
humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that

saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The
harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns
to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The
song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.
While charmed by the harpy, a target is
incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If
the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the
harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the
harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5
feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before
moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and
whenever it takes damage from a source other than
the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A
charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is
successful, the effect ends on it.
A target that successfully saves is immune to this
harpy's song for the next 24 hours.

damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns.
If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single
turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed
on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that
turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall
prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the

random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown
target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6)
bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If
the target is thrown at another creature, that creature
must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or
take the same damage and be knocked prone.

bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the
kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must

**_Petrifying Gaze.
_** When a creature that can see the
medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the
medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14
Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't
incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving
throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly
petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save
begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The
restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at
the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure
or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts
until the creature is freed by the
 _greater restoration_
spell or other magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to
avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the
creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start
of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the
creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must
immediately make the save.
If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished

```
surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light,
the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own
gaze.

Ooze Cube. The cube takes up its entire space. Other
creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does
so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has
disadvantage on the saving throw.
Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total
cover.
A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an
```

action to pull a creature or object out of the cube.
Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength check,
and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6)
acid damage.
The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to
four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.

**_Transparent.
_** Even when the cube is in plain sight, it
takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to
spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A
creature that tries to enter the cube's space while
unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.

##### Actions

ft., one creature.
 _Hit:_ 10 (3d6) acid damage.

**_Engulf._** The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so,
it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces.
Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the
creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.
On a successful save, the creature can choose to be
pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A
creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the
consequences of a failed saving throw.
On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's
space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage
and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is
restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start
of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the
engulfed creature moves with it.
An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an
action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success,
the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice
within 5 feet of the cube.

target.
 Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is
a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw against disease or become poisoned until
the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the
target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit
point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is
cured on a success. The target dies if the disease
reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to
the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is
cured.
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target.
 Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4
(1d8) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or

at a time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit
points; immunity to poison and psychic damage).
Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper,
which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next
turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an
action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against
it.
Spider Climb.
 The roper can climb difficult surfaces,
including upside down on ceilings, without needing to
make an ability check.
```

by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11 Dexterity
saving throw to avoid the rust monster's touch.

to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises that
was predefined by the spellcaster, the guardian casts
the stored spell with any parameters set by the original
caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast
or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is
lost.

target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command,
it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a
success. If the target successfully saves against the

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)._** If the tarrasque fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Magic Resistance._** The tarrasque has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Reflective Carapace._** Any time the tarrasque is
targeted by a
 _magic missile
_ spell, a line spell, or a spell
that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5,
the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is
unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the
caster as though it originated from the tarrasque,
turning the caster into the target.

**_Siege Monster.
_** The tarrasque deals double damage to
objects and structures.

##### Actions

```
Multiattack. The tarrasque can use its Frightful
Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite,
two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its
tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target.
 Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the
target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until
this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the
tarrasque can't bite another target.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft.,
one target.
 Hit:
 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.
Horns. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft.,

 Hit: 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage.
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one
target.
 Hit: 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the
target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Frightful Presence.
 Each creature of the tarrasque's
choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with
disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight,
ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful
Presence for the next 24 hours.
Swallow. The tarrasque makes one bite attack against
a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack
hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is
swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the
creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover
against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque,
and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each
of the tarrasque's turns.
If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single
turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must
succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the
end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures,
which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the
tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature
is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the
corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.
```

```
Shapechanger. If the vampire isn't in sunlight or
running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a
Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its
true form.
While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its
walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30
feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are
unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it,
but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true
form if it dies.
While in mist form, the vampire can't take any
actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless,
has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter
a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if
air can pass through a space, the mist can do so
without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It
has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
```

saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical
damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)._** If the vampire fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Misty Escape._** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its
resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of
mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling
unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or
running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.
While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert
to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place
within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting
place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed
until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1
hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit
point.

**_Regeneration._** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the
start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in
sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant
damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't
function at the start of the vampire's next turn.

**_Spider Climb._** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces,
including upside down on ceilings, without needing to
make an ability check.

**_Vampire Weaknesses._** The vampire has the following
flaws:
_Forbiddance.
_ The vampire can't enter a residence
without an invitation from one of the occupants.
_Harmed by Running Water._ The vampire takes 20
acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
_Stake to the Heart.
_ If a piercing weapon made of
wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the
vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the
vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.
_Sunlight Hypersensitivity._ The vampire takes 20
radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight.
While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls
and ability checks.

##### Actions

**_Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).
_** The vampire makes
two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

**_Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)._** _Melee Weapon
Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
 _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 +
4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage,
the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

**_Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)._** _Melee Weapon
Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a
creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated,

```
or restrained.
 Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10
(3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum
is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage
taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that
amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a
long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit
point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and
then buried in the ground rises the following night as a
vampire spawn under the vampire's control.
Charm. The vampire targets one humanoid it can see
within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire,
the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving
throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire.
The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted
friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target
isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's
requests or actions in the most favorable way it can,
and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.
Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions
do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the
saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the
vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of
existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to
end the effect.
Children of the Night (1/Day). The vampire magically
calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun
isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6
wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4
rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its
spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until
the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them
as a bonus action.
```
##### Legendary Actions

# Appendix PH-A:

# Conditions

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety
of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class
feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most
conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a
few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.
A condition lasts either until it is countered (the
prone condition is countered by standing up, for
example) or for a duration specified by the effect
that imposed the condition.
If multiple effects impose the same condition on a
creature, each instance of the condition has its own
duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse.
A creature either has a condition or doesn't.
The following definitions specify what happens to
a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

#### Blinded

- A blinded creature can't see and automatically
 fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,
 and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

#### Charmed

- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or
 target the charmer with harmful abilities or
 magical effects.
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to
 interact socially with the creature.

#### Deafened

- A deafened creature can't hear and automatically
 fails any ability check that requires hearing.

##### Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as
starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching
temperatures, can lead to a special condition called
exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect
can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as
specified in the effect's description.

**Level
 Effect**
1
 Disadvantage on ability checks
2
 Speed halved
3
 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4
 Hit point maximum halved
5
 Speed reduced to 0

```
6
 Death
```

```
If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that
causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases
by the amount specified in the effect's description.
A creature suffers the effect of its current level of
exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature
suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has
disadvantage on ability checks.
An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as
specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion
effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced
below 1.
Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level
by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food
and drink.
```
#### Frightened

- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability
 checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear
 is within line of sight.
- The creature can't willingly move closer to the
 source of its fear.

#### Grappled

- A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it
 can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated
 (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the
 grappled creature from the reach of the grappler
 or grappling effect, such as when a creature is
 hurled away by the
 _thunder-wave_ spell.

#### Incapacitated

- An incapacitated creature can't take actions or
 reactions.

#### Invisible

- An invisible creature is impossible to see without
 the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose
 of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The
 creature's location can be detected by any noise it
 makes or any tracks it leaves.
- Attack rolls against the creature have
 disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have
 advantage.

#### Paralyzed

- A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the
 condition) and can't move or speak.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.


- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if
 the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

#### Petrified

- A petrified creature is transformed, along with any
 nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a
 solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its
 weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases
 aging.
- The creature is incapacitated (see the condition),
 can't move or speak, and is unaware of its
 surroundings.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- The creature has resistance to all damage.
- The creature is immune to poison and disease,
 although a poison or disease already in its system
 is suspended, not neutralized.

#### Poisoned

- A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack
 rolls and ability checks.

#### Prone

- A prone creature's only movement option is to
 crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the
 condition.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- An attack roll against the creature has advantage if
 the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
 Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

#### Restrained

- A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it
 can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,
 and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
- The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving
 throws.

#### Stunned

- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the
 condition), can't move, and can speak only
 falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

#### Unconscious

- An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the
 condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of
 its surroundings
- The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls
 prone.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and
 Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if
 the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.


# Appendix PH-B:

# Fantasy-Historical

# Pantheons

The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are
fantasy interpretations of historical religions from
our world's ancient times. They include deities that
are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced
from their historical context in the real world and
united into pantheons that serve the needs of the
game.

#### The Celtic Pantheon

It's said that something wild lurks in the heart of
every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese
calling at night, to the whispering wind through the
pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an
oak--and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell.
They sprang from the brook and stream, their might
heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty
of the woodlands and open moor. When the first
forester dared put a name to the face seen in the
bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these
gods forced themselves into being.
The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by
clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of
nature that druids revere.

#### The Greek Pantheon

The gods of Olympus make themselves known with
the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the
crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded
peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere,
olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing.
Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence,
and they've made a place for themselves inside the
human heart, too.

#### The Egyptian Pantheon

```
These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine
family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the
maintenance of the divine principle of Ma'at--the
fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order
that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men
and women in their logical and rightful place in the
universe.
The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three
gods responsible for death, each with different
alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the
afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a
chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for
killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic
good goddess of mourning.
```
#### The Norse Pantheon

```
Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into
the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up
on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and
retreat with every fall and spring--this is the land of
the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It's a
brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The
warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh
conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been
too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given
the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it's
surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did.
Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for
strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see
their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in
the crash of the thunder and the booming of the
glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning
longhouse.
The Norse pantheon includes two main families,
the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir
(gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies,
these two families are now closely allied against
their common enemies, the giants (including the
gods Surtur and Thrym).

# Appendix PH-C:

# The Planes of

# Existence

The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well
as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the
**planes of existence** . It encompasses every world
where GMs run their adventures, all within the
relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane.
Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental
matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos,
the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions
of the gods.
Many spells and magic items can draw energy
from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell
the re, communicate with their denizens, and allow
adventurers to travel there. As your character
achieves greater power and higher levels, you might
walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle
on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with
each dawn.

## The Material Plane

The Material Plane is the nexus where the
philosophical and elemental forces that define the
other planes collide in the jumbled existence of
mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming
worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the
starting point for most campaigns and adventures.
The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to
the Material Plane.
The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely
diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of
the GMs who set their games there, as well as the
players whose heroes adventure there. They include
magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted
water worlds, worlds where magic combines with
advanced technology and others trapped in an
endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and
places they have abandoned.

## Beyond the Material

Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of
existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're
not simply other worlds, but different qualities of
being, formed and governed by spiritual and
elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary
world.

### Planar Travel

```
When adventurers travel into other planes of
existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey
across the thresholds of existence to a mythic
destination where they strive to complete their
quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving
the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial
servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in
its home city will be the subject of song and story for
years to come.
Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can
be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or
by using a planar portal.
Spells.
 A number of spells allow direct or indirect
access to other planes of existence.
 Plane shift and
gate can transport adventurers directly to any other
plane of existence, with different degrees of
precision.
 Etherealness allows adventurers to enter
the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of
the planes it touches--such as the Elemental Planes.
And the
 astral projection spell lets adventurers
project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel
to the Outer Planes.
Portals. A portal is a general term for a stationary
interplanar connection that links a specific location
on one plane to a specific location on another. Some
portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-
shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it
effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations--
circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing
ships, or even whole towns--that exist in multiple
planes at once or flicker from one plane to another
in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an
Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the
Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano
(leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the
ocean (to the Plane of Water).
```
### Transitive Planes

```
The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called
the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless
realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from
one plane to another. Spells such as etherealness and
astral projection allow characters to enter these
planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.
The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound
dimension that is sometimes described as a great
ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap
the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that
every location on those planes has a corresponding
location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can
see into the Border Ethereal, and the
 see invisibility
```

and
 _true seeing_ spell grant that ability. Some magical
effects also extend from the Material Plane into the
Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force
energy such as
 _forcecage_ and
 _wall of force._ The
depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region
of swirling mists and colorful fogs.
The ** Astral Plane** is the realm of thought and
dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to
reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a
great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with
swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among
motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic
whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning
coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found
here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open
domain.

### Inner Planes

The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material
Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental
substance from which all the worlds were made. The
four
 **Elemental Planes** --Air, Earth, Fire, and
Water--form a ring around the Material Plane,
suspended within the churning
 **Elemental Chaos** .
At their innermost edges, where they are closest
to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal
geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes
resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four
elements mingle together as they do in the Material
Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the
Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are
both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in
their purest form--great expanses of solid earth,
blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air.
These regions are little-known, so when discussing
the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually
means just the border region. At the farthest extents
of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and
bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing
energies and colliding substance, the Elemental
Chaos.

### Outer Planes

If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy
that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are
the direction, thought and purpose for such
construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the
Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or
godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as
the homes of deities.
When discussing anything to do with deities, the
language used must be highly metaphorical. Their

```
actual homes are not literally "places" at all, but
exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms
of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes,
one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer
Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive
spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory
experience.
Even in those perceptible regions, appearances
can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes
appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the
Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the
whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer
Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell
on these planes can remake them completely,
effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to
better fulfill their own needs.
Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the
Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes
often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on
to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to
take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first
layer to the ninth, in a single day--if the powers of
the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for
travelers to make a grueling trek across a single
layer.
The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of
sixteen planes that correspond to the eight
alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of
distinction between them.
```
#### Outer Planes

```
The planes with some element of good in their
nature are called the
 Upper Planes . Celestial
creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the
Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are
the
 Lower Planes . Fiends such as demons and devils
dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is its
essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't
match the plane's experiences a profound sense of
dissonance there. When a good creature visits
Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane),
it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature
feels out of tune and more than a little
uncomfortable.
```
#### Demiplanes

```
Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with
their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality
that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes
come into being by a variety of means. Some are
created by spells, such as
 demiplane, or generated at
the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They
may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that
```

has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse,
or as a baby universe growing in power. A given
demiplane can be entered through a single point
where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a
_plane shift_ spell can also carry travelers to a
demiplane, but the proper frequency required for
the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The
_gate_ spell is more reliable, assuming the caster
knows of the demiplane.

The majestic giant elk is rare to the point that its appearance is often taken

divine wrath.

The arctic-dwelling **winter wolf** is as large as a dire wolf but has
snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil creatures as
guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves' deadly breath weapon to use

A worg is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures
weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote
wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs
as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or
malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to
speak Common as well.


# Appendix MM-B:

# Nonplayer

# Characters

This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid nonplayer characters
(NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign, including lowly
commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be used to represent
both human and nonhuman NPCs.

### Customizing NPCs

There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home
campaign.

**_Racial Traits. _** You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a
halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding
racial traits to an NPC doesn't alter its challenge rating. For more on racial
traits, see the _Player's Handbook_ .

**_Spell Swaps._** One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one
or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC's spell list
with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping
spells in this manner doesn't alter an NPC's challenge rating.

**_Armor and Weapon Swaps._** You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC's armor, or
add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an
NPC's challenge rating.

**_Magic Items. _** The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or
more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a
magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC
a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.

**Archmages** are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to
the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while
evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor
evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without
interruption.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's
abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

Assassinate. During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls
against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores
against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

Evasion. If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no
damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

Sneak Attack. Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when
it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or
when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't
incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
```

##### Actions

```
Multiattack. The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.
Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15

**Bandits** rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or
spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or
famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.
**Pirates** are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested
only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the
crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.

 _Hit:

3) piercing damage.

##### Reactions

```
Parry. The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit
it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee
weapon.
```

```
It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a
gang of bandits in line. The bandit captain has these qualities in spades. In
addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a
variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep
the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a
regular basis. More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves
infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely
to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know
anything of the captain's colorful reputation.
